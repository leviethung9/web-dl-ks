Faith Rules</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>5 Nguyên tắc đảm bảo các group theo tinh thần Của WordPress khi tổ chức meetup xây dựng cộng đồng</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Phi lợi nhuận: Hướng tới cả cộng đồng, không phục vụ cho một tổ chức kinh doanh nào.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mọi người đều được tham gia, không phân biệt về tiền bạc, khả năng về lập trình…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Không trả tiền cho Speakers, nếu có chi phí thêm thì chỉ là những chi phí cho meetup như thuê địa điểm, nước uống.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Các meetup có thể do bất cứ ai trong group mà có thể tin tưởng được để tổ chức.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Không có các hành động xúc phạm về bất cứ ai, bất cứ vấn đề gì trong meetup.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3af.png\" alt=\"🎯\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;

quyền.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>#NhaTrangWordPress #MeetUp #NhaTrang

The Community Team had loosened some of the requirements for WordCamps in order to foster a more welcoming environment for people to want to host in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to modernize these gatherings moving forward, the team has proposed the following update to the purpose of WordPress events:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin said she hopes a &#8220;period of innovation and experimentation will follow this critical shift in the purpose of our events&#8221; where events will be curated for more narrow audiences and have a focus on a specific type of content or topic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift also opens the door for more varied event formats, such as workshops, unconferences, job fairs, and pure networking events &#8211; which would have definitively been outside the traditional WordCamps of old and not officially supported by the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin emphasized that WordPress will continue encouraging local meetups. Currently planned WordCamps (there are currently 14 on the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">schedule</a> for 2023) can continue as before but new WordCamp applicants will be encouraged to experiment with new formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Flagships (<a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp US</a>, <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Europe</a>, <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Asia</a>): These will remain our largest, broadest event that fully capitalizes on the energy of a large crowd,&#8221; Jin said. &#8220;They will be the place to highlight the latest, greatest, and coolest in WordPress and where we are going.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Reactions to the change in the purpose of WordCamp have been mostly positive but the community has some questions about how it will work. David Bisset, who helped run WordCamp Miami for over a decade, asks how this will impact smaller communities:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I certainly would love to see more formats being tried, more standout content, etc. However, I’m trying to view this from a local and smaller WordCamp organizer mindset – what if I have a varied community and therefore a varied audience? Will having a particular audience in mind in setting content and promoting local WordCamps unknowingly not attract a more diverse audience? Many people come to conferences and WordCamps for certain talks and speakers and stay around for the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developer David McCan <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/05/08/the-next-generation-of-wordcamps/#comment-30874\">commented</a> that the new purpose statement reads more like educating and preparing a workforce in contrast to how WordCamps previously leaned towards empowering volunteers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in the discussion are heavily in favor of giving more freedom to event organizers, but many have had irreplaceable experiences at WordCamps in their current format that they are reluctant to see it go. WordPress developer and contributor Ross Wintle commented that he hoped the change in purpose would not diminish the diversity at WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I think there’s some value in focussing on an audience, please don’t throw out the current WordCamps,&#8221; Wintle said. &#8220;I genuinely believe that one of the best things about these events is that I get to experience the diversity of the WordPress community and see the many, many different ways that WordPress is used, extended and developed for, and I get to meet the many, many talented people from across the spectrum of contribution who possess ideas, skills and experiences that I do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve met so many amazing people who have different roles in WordPress, and I think the value of this is far higher than sitting in my bubble with the people that do the same things as me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing contributor Sé Reed asked Jin what team meeting, GitHub issue, or other documented discussion was available to follow the decision-making process for this major change to WordCamps, as no discussions were linked in the announcement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To my mind, this kind of change (affecting the entire WordPress community and apparently effective immediately) is something that would make sense to discuss at the Community Summit,&#8221; Reed said. &#8220;As that ship has sailed, I’d like to at least see the discussion that led to it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin has not yet responded to these questions but said in the announcement that as event organizers experiment with different formats for WordCamps, &#8220;the community team can reevaluate our full events program and how events coexist happily.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 May 2023 01:55:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WordPress Foundation: Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship for WordCamp US 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=456908\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/news/2023/kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-for-wordcamp-us-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1530:\"<p>The WordPress Foundation will once again offer the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship for travel to <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp US 2023</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At each in-person WordCamp US, the WordPress Foundation honors Kim’s commitment and valuable contributions to the WordPress open source project.

AI-powered website creation could even become a threat to its existence, more than a competing CMS, if WordPress doesn&#8217;t ensure the platform is easily pluggable for AI-powered extensions. A new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/02/lets-talk-wordpress-core-artificial-intelligence/\">discussion</a> on the Core developer&#8217;s blog asks what WordPress can do to better enable AI innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress Core always seeks to provide a stable foundation for folks to build upon directly and extend as they see fit,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored core contributor Anne McCarthy said. &#8220;Even if a new technology is not actually included in Core, the project aims to enable innovation and progress through extension (plugins, themes, etc.) wherever possible and sensible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy shared a video of what it might look like to have AI integrated into Gutenberg&#8217;s experimental command center to build out pages based on AI-suggested designs. She asked three questions of contributors: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How would you want to see Core updated so it can be extended in ways accessible to AI technologies?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For those&nbsp; building, or trying to build, with AI today, how does Core currently enable or hinder this effort?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are there any concerns that you think the community should be aware of as this space is explored?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg is optimistic about the prospect of further integrating AI into open source development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2015 I told you to learn Javascript deeply,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1680473547032499\">said</a> last month in the Post Status Slack. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a catchy phrase yet, but my message for 2023 will be to spend as much time leveraging AI as possible. The boosts to productivity and capability are <em>amazing</em>. This is not a web3/crypto/widgets hype cycle. It&#8217;s real.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also encouraged WordPress professionals to consider how AI and open source can work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Open source and AI are the two mega-trends of the next 30 years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They complement each other, and you should think deeply about how. ChatGPT can&#8217;t ready Shopify&#8217;s code.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StellarWP-sponsored contributor Matt Cromwell <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/02/lets-talk-wordpress-core-artificial-intelligence/#comment-44809\">commented</a> on the latest core discussion, suggesting that AI innovation is better left to plugin developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All AI options currently require integration with a 3rd party system, some sort of pricing and authentication, this feels to me to clearly be plugin territory,&#8221; Cromwell said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The other concern here is that the current Core roadmap is very full. At what cost would the project chase an AI integration? At the expense of multi-editing collaboration features? At the expense of multi-lingual features? I find it hard to imagine pursuing the current roadmap with excellence and stability AND adding a huge AI integration as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost-sponsored contributor Jonathan Desrosiers, one of the reviewers of the post, clarified that the intention was to &#8220;fuel discussion around what AI looks like in the WordPress ecosystem and how that may be blocked currently.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As you said, the roadmap is definitely full and adding new things should not be done unless there are extremely compelling reasons,&#8221; Desrosiers said. &#8220;But, if there are small “paper cut” changes that can be made in Core (new filter or action hooks, etc.) to allow plugins to better experiment and flesh out AI integrations in the WordPress world, I think that we certainly should consider these.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cromwell suggested WordPress could add a settings panel for integrating various API&#8217;s, such as payment gateways and OpenAI API keys, to prevent conflicts and streamline API usage across multiple plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Glidden proposed that contributors consider the possibility of having AI chatbots as a user type for the future collaboration workflow inside WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I would suggest looking at AI chatbots as (“just another”) user type in the upcoming Phase 3 of collaboration/workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I for one want an AI chatbot on my multiuser collaboration team in a phase 3 WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the multiuser collaborative workflows already described in “<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Phase 3 Collaboration</a>” it seems like basically the same infrastructure should work for both human users and AI “users”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, it is not a huge stretch in reading that document to think of “users”, “collaborators”, and “creators” as also being bot-ish users, assigned and performing tasks within a workflow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>CodeWP-sponsored contributor James LePage echoed Cromwell&#8217;s concerns that focusing too much on integrating AI might make WordPress less competitive on the features that have already been identified for Gutenberg&#8217;s Phase 3 roadmap:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>As some others said here, as a WP&nbsp;<em>user</em>, I’d much prefer a really strong focus on the existing Phase 3 roadmap items as I think it would make our CMS a lot more valuable and competitive to other tools out there, as opposed to integrating AI somehow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing is that there aren’t really any standards here. There are large players, but they keep changing the way their AI works, and probably will continue to do so. We’d be trying to hit a moving target.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as WordPress contributors are spread thin across the project&#8217;s current Gutenberg roadmap of goals and improvements, you don&#8217;t get to choose when new technology is bearing down on your industry, forcing you to act or become obsolete. The WordPress community has built a robust plugin ecosystem, but leaving it all to third-party integrations may not be enough to keep the software relevant in the coming years. Ensuring that WordPress is compatible with the future of AI-powered innovation is critical if contributors want the platform to continue to be the best CMS and website builder available on the web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 May 2023 21:52:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 55: Happy Anniversary, WordPress!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=14949\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/episode-55-happy-anniversary-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15023:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy in the 55th episode of the WordPress Briefing as she looks back at the 20 years of WordPress and how the open source community made WordPress what it is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you’d like answered?

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard yet. WordPress is celebrating its 20th anniversary on May 27th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of celebrations and parties happening all across the world, hopefully with cake, because we all know that a party without cake is just a meeting and no one wants a year-long meeting about how old you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:59]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;ve not yet joined the celebrations, there&#8217;s still time to share your favorite WordPress merch, your favorite WordCamp memory, host a whole dang party if you want to, or share a video to post on wp20.wordpress.net. I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, WordPress is the leading CMS in the market. And according to W3Tech&#8217;s it powers 43% of the web. And that&#8217;s like 35% of the top 10,000 sites that are built using this software. And sometimes, that&#8217;s as a website, sometimes as a framework, but always as a way for people and businesses to find a space on the web to call their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:45]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021. The first-ever study on the WordPress ecosystem gave us an idea of just how large our ecosystem is. We already kind of had a sense that millions of people make a living through WordPress because we know that we are supporting small business owners and freelancers all the way out to agencies and content creators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But according to that study, WordPress at the time was powering 82 million websites and enabled an estimated economy of $597 billion. The success of an economy like this and various other alternative economies hinges on the success of invisible open source software that powers the web, just like WordPress, that has a tonne of growth and a lot of wins since that first Cafe Log fork way back in 2003.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress could just say pencils down, everybody. Good job, team, and just kind of watch what comes next. But I&#8217;ve never met a word processor, emboldened as we are by our belief in open source freedoms, who stepped away from a challenge worth facing the recognition that everyone should have those freedoms whether they know they exist or not. Because I know that no one cares as much about open source freedoms as open source maintainers. But the recognition that everyone has the right to them anyway is built into the foundations of what WordPress is and who WordPress is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are big plans for WordPress future, many of which are grounded in the promise of a new block editor within WordPress that aims to lower the barriers to entry for people at any point in their learning curve. So let&#8217;s take a look at what this means for WordPress, the software, and follow up about what it means for the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the software right at the end of 2018, the Gutenberg editor was merged into WordPress Core. And it&#8217;s subverted the way that people had always managed their content. It brought with it this new concept of site building that focused on blocks as the primary mode of creation. It was modular and required very little code knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably also very little skill with design. Although if you&#8217;ve ever seen me tried to design something with blocks, you will know it takes some skill. But still, the ultimate goal was to make those fundamental user interactions of managing the block and apply them in any place you could manage your site using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think about the possibility to create media-rich content without having to work with shortcode, without having to know HTML workarounds, it opens the opportunity for many of us in the WordPress community to own our digital presence. In case it wasn&#8217;t already clear, this, my friends, is an audacious project, and it&#8217;s even more so if you remember that we have this existing and massive ecosystem that is enabled and empowered by our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:42]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as we look forward to the third phase of the Gutenberg Project, collaborative editing inside a WordPress installation will soon be a reality, which if you are like me and you never work on a website alone, you&#8217;re probably just dying to have. I say all this not to toot the horn have WordPress or belabor our success but rather to emphasize the importance of what I&#8217;m going to say next, which is how this CMS got to where it is, namely through the work of the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has survived, and I would dare to say thrived through decades of constant economic, cultural, and technological shifts. And I believe that the thing that keeps us innovating fast enough to stay relevant but slow enough to be ethical, is how the community actively engages with the open source project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that our strength is directly tied to the resilience of our contributors. And we know that the software we ship is shaped by the people who are willing to tell us what they love, what they hate, and what they hope to see. When the WordPress project started, we mainly had code contributions as a way to give back, but over time, the project has grown to include contributions to learning, community building, and translations, among other things, but all of that exists alongside the CMS-focused contributions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because WordPress as an organization understands that it is an integral part of an ecosystem of 1000s of global companies and millions of individual people who are building careers, starting businesses, learning new skills, and becoming part of something meaningful. I know that I talk just all the time about the greatness of WordPress as a software and community, which makes sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:29]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really do love the work I do with you all. But I am equally in awe of this open-hearted journey of disruption that WordPress represents as an open source project. WordPress and its community is part of a long line of disruptors; blogs made publishing available to everyone, which maybe doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal right now because you&#8217;ve been around blogging forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:51]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve been able to just put your thoughts on the internet with almost no effort for as long as you have known the internet existed, but WordPress, at the time, was and honestly remains the low code open source CMS of choice. It has been for years. And so, let me backtrack you through the 10,000-foot milestones of our journey here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:14]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg has been around since 2013. It&#8217;s 10 years. I know, don&#8217;t get scared, we&#8217;re celebrating 20 years. So it&#8217;s been around for half of our time as a concept. Open source as a concept was formalized in the 1980s. Though it definitely has been around longer than that as a concept and a way of working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this low-code, no-code movement that we hear about from time to time that has been around since the 1970s, and just because we first became aware of it in the 1970s doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s when it actually first was discussed or thought about or used. Which means that you are in this moment, decades deep into projects that changed our entire understanding of the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:59]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So grab a slice of cake, and raise a glass to 20 great years of WordPress, and I am going to raise a glass to 20 more years of continuing our journey together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us effervescently to the small list of big things. Yeah, I said effervescently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:24]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are a lot of things happening in the WordPress project over the next couple of weeks. There is a lot of testing going on. There are a lot of releases that are getting underway. There are events and things. So here&#8217;s my rundown of stuff you should take a look at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, there is a post out about performance improvements from 6.2. That is just inviting an open discussion so that we can get more of those improvements in better shape to get into the 6.3 release. And speaking of the 6.3 release that is coming, just last week, we announced the release squad that we have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an extra heavy release squad because we also are working toward the 6.4 release just at the same time. So there&#8217;s the folks who are running the 6.3 release, and they have committed to working openly and in public channels as much as possible so that the 6.4 folks have a chance to really take a look at what goes into a release, the questions that we ask, the philosophies we believe in, and then that 6.4 release oil pick up probably, my guess is August-ish, mid-August or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That 6.4 release is specifically going to be made up entirely of diverse genders. People that we historically see are underrepresented in technology, but as always, we accept contributions from everyone for all releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:48]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing is that we have WordCamp Europe coming up, that is June 8 and 10th. So a little bit past the two-week mark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a final call for volunteers for anyone who wants to be able to help at the event. I personally have always enjoyed doing that kind of volunteer work. It helps you get to know your community even a bit better. And I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;m just kind of an extroverted people person. So, of course, I always want to volunteer, but that call is still open. And they&#8217;re in the last phases of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a team or two that needs some help with getting leads for the contributor day that happens leading up to WordCamp. Europe, I know that the testing team needs a lead for the table, and so if you enjoy the process of triaging or testing or helping people get their environment set up, that is a great opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my small, my big small list of big things is that we have a kind of a review of the currently defined contributor ladder for the Polyglots team. There are a number of posts over the years where we talk about the ways that people move through being a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:57]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that we know about almost all contributor ladders is that there&#8217;s no time requirement between the steps, but in general, it functions like a ladder. So you do have to have, like, rung one. And then, rung two, if you try to skip from rung one to rung three, you will have a lot of difficulty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not impossible, but it&#8217;s harder than going 1, 2, 3 In the normal sequential order. And so that&#8217;s a whole discussion that&#8217;s happening over there. There&#8217;s a link to all of these things in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:28]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy,  and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 May 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"Do The Woo Community: What Will Be the Biggest Impact on WordPress and WooCommerce Builders with AI?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75067\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://dothewoo.io/what-will-be-the-biggest-impact-on-ecommerce-with-ai/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:434:\"<p>As a member of the WordPress and WooCommerce builder community, share your insights on AI and it\'s impact.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/what-will-be-the-biggest-impact-on-ecommerce-with-ai/\">What Will Be the Biggest Impact on WordPress and WooCommerce Builders with AI?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 May 2023 09:00:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg 15.7, WooCommerce Blocks 10.1, and 299 block themes –Weekend Edition #253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=24060\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/gutenberg-15-7-woocommerce-blocks-10-1-and-299-block-themes-weekend-edition-253/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20968:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a short week for me, yet fully packed with updates. After assembling a loaner sleeper sofa bed, my husband and I spent our first night in the new apartment. We called it the <em>MUC-Life Achievement #2</em>. If you are interested, <em>MUC-Life Achievement #1</em> was getting the Internet into the place and the router to work. Apart from the sofa bed, we took out a loan from friends and family for two chairs, two tables, a small set of plates, silverware, and kitchen tools. Now we are ready to camp out at our apartment until our furniture arrives from the US. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, planning for WordPress 6.3 and 6.4 is in full swing. I expect to read more about both release cycles in the coming days. A new Gutenberg plugin version is now available and new block themes were released. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That and more you&#8217;ll find below in the round-up of news.

You can draw from a full site editing setting, a pattern, a custom block style, a copied-in style, or a generated pattern. The theme is the bundler, the package – the wrapper that all this great stuff gets put in to share and activate. That is what ‘the theme as the package’ means, it is the method to carry everything, and it’s almost a de-escalation of the term.&#8221; she wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the post, Lister also raises the issue of confusing terms and that there should be more distinct, more granular filters than just the one called &#8220;block themes&#8221;. It suggests that all block themes are the same, yet, not all themes come with patterns or style variations or many block styles. Maybe now with almost 300 block themes in the repository, adding additional feature filters might need to contemplate. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Snow</strong> published a short video tutorial on <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/importing-widget-areas-from-a-classic-theme-to-a-block-theme/\"><strong>Importing widget areas from a classic theme to a block theme</strong></a>.

He identified the two most important issues this design change solves &#8211; the lack of a parent selector for nested blocks and the overall increase in the editor&#8217;s UI footprint. The toolbar has been updated in the following ways: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>updates on desktop sized viewports the position of the fixed toolbar</li>\n\n\n\n<li>updates the z-index of the interface header to be lower to that block toolbar shows up on top</li>\n\n\n\n<li>implements a toggle expanded/collapsed for block contextual toolbar</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Image Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49634#issuecomment-1501597370\">PR updating Top Toolbar fixed setting</a>\n\n\n\n<p>This change will require feedback from Gutenberg plugin users, as feedback among contributors has been mixed so far. WordPress core committer and accessibility contributor Andrea Fercia weighed in on the PR, suggesting it requires more testing:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>A11y-wise there are more issues with this implementation at the point that I wouldn&#8217;t know where to start.

This growth brings challenges, such as increased competition and the need for WordPress professionals to continuously adapt and upskill to stay relevant in the industry. Keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in the WordPress ecosystem is critical. This includes learning new programming languages and frameworks, as well as staying up-to-date on design trends and best practices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engage the Community. </strong>The WordPress community is a supportive and collaborative group of individuals and organizations. WordPress professionals can benefit greatly from participating in the community, whether that&#8217;s by attending local WordPress meetups, contributing to open-source projects, or joining online communities like the WordPress subreddit or the WordPress Slack channel. By building a strong community around your WordPress website or business, you can establish yourself as a trusted authority in the WordPress space and create long-term relationships with your audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Content is STILL King.</strong> When it comes to building a successful WordPress website, you need excellent, engaging content. To stand out in the crowded online marketplace, WordPress professionals need to create valuable, high-quality content that resonates with their audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Security Should Be a Top Priority.</strong> Since WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world, it&#8217;s also a popular target for hackers.

Yeah, there you go. It gets weather, it gets windy in Switzerland.\n\nOr at least that\'s what it looks like behind you. Yeah. \n\nCory Miller: Well that\'s a good effect. \n\nCorey Maass: This is our backyard gets, weather gets windy in Switzerland. Yeah. \n\nCory Miller: When I get you back out here, we\'ll, uh, you\'ll see the, \n\nCorey Maass: that\'d be amazing. You have lots of echo. This is our back hair against wind Indian Switzer.\n\nOkay. \n\nCory Miller: Always fun going live. Uh, well, hey, it is, uh, session 12. We\'re talking about corn Corey on WordPress products. So Corey, forgive me for letting this slip off my calendar, but we\'re live, I\'m outside enjoying the weather while the wind cooperates. If it gets too windy or [00:01:00] something, \n\nCorey Maass: I\'ll go inside. All right.\n\nMakes sense. I should be outside. It\'s beautiful. But it is also windy here too. The dogs are starting to enjoy it anyway. \n\nCory Miller: Well, um, you\'ve been busy, man, working on the new product. \n\nCorey Maass: Yeah, so, uh, omg, I m G is coming along very well. Um, I, at this point we\'ve got almost a working plugin. I think I\'m down to, as we had talked about, um, the.\n\nThe goal for a first version is to be able to create an image and then save it as the open graph image for a site. Um, I\'d already marched pretty far down the trail for making images for posts, and so using that as a starting point. [00:02:00] Uh, at this point you can edit images for posts, save them as the featured image, and then, um, I\'m close to being able to save as the open graph image.\n\nAnd then I, because the code is basically gonna be the same for if you\'re editing posts or like, it\'s, it\'s kind of like signing into Canva, which I think is our, um, analog, um, the, you sign in, you see projects, you click on a project, you edit a project, meaning an image, and then do something with it.\n\nDownload it. Save it as a featured image, save it as an open graph image. Um, so I abstracted that out so that there\'s basically an instance of, of the app, um, attached to a post or attached to the overall site. Um, and so now it\'s just a matter of like connecting the last, basically the last few wires to save an [00:03:00] image as the open graph image for a site, um, without, and initially without, uh, any assumptions about having Yost or all in one s e o or any of those installed.\n\nUm, and then I will, uh, look into, like Yost has a, a really nice filter that makes it easy to overwrite the, their open graph image for the site. Um, and, and I, I\'m hoping that the other s e o plugins do too. So at that point we\'re, we\'re off and running. Um, I also, uh, I don\'t remember why, um, but I, I think just cuz I needed something different to do but wanted to feel productive, I installed e D D on O M G I M G and so that\'s kind of, that\'s the basics are set up.\n\nOh cuz I wanted to [00:04:00] plug in, um, a bank account and stripe and stuff like that. So that\'s all ready to go. Um, there\'s nothing, I haven\'t, I haven\'t actually set up the plugin to, to use a license key yet, but that\'s, e d d makes it pretty easy. Um, they\'ve got a class that just gets abstracted, so, um, so yeah, probably another week of hacking.\n\nAnd, um, I mean we do need, we need a logo. I. We need, um, some decisions to, uh, we, I think we\'ve, we\'ve both sort of in the context of discussion, not decision. We both sort of have said that we, with this will in INI at least initially, will forego a free version in the repo. Um, and just, I always wanna say and just punt, but I\'ve been told that that\'s an, uh, improper use of the, the sports analogy.\n\nBut anyway, we\'ll kick it down the road. Um, or we\'ll [00:05:00] just, we\'ll just go whatever. \n\nCory Miller: Yeah, no punt works for me. Um, okay. So let me, let me get back and make sure I\'m clear on what you said regarding where the work that you\'ve done. Yes. So the site default open graph image is ready. Close. Close. And then you started working on the per post.\n\nCorey Maass: Work. Uh, I mean, the other way around really the, because I, I had already gone down the trail of per post. Um, that one\'s actually more flushed out, but it was great because it was, it\'s easy, it\'s actually easier to attach images to a post than to attach images to a site, right? Because yeah, posts have featured images, sites don\'t, and so it\'s, it\'s a little more abstract.\n\nUm, so yeah, posts. [00:06:00] Um, but then, uh, so the, so posts can now, so you can make an image and attach it to a post as a featured image, and then, uh, and then I\'m looping back to essentially set the open graph image for either a single post or for an entire site. And that\'s what I think we can launch with.\n\nBecause the idea, the idea is like, you know, for most blogs, most WordPress websites, the homepage is a page. It might be an archive page, it might be a page page. Um, but there\'s no, there\'s no featured image attached. Uh, well, I guess there is sometimes for a page, but, um, you know, that\'s what, um, but you want an open graph image, right?\n\nLike if I share the post status homepage, you know, that image has to come from somewhere. Um, but then if [00:07:00] you go into a blog post on post status and you share it, By default, it should be the same open graph image as the entire site. But you might, you might want to create a individual open graph image for that post.\n\nSo it\'s like, if you go to the post status homepage and share it, you see post status is awesome. But if you go to a blog post a, where you\'ve interviewed Corey, this awesome developer, you want, and you share it, you want it to say, post status is awesome. Read about Corey. Yeah. Okay. \n\nCory Miller: So I think I understand where you\'re at with all that.\n\nUm, regarding the decisions, last thing you said there, what does, what do we need to make? So, sorry, I think I\'m, I\'m getting this, but for launch, I think what you\'re saying is for launch we\'ll have default site and host option.\n\nCorey Maass: [00:08:00] Okay. Yeah. I think cuz it\'s, you know, we, we essentially, we have a builder. That.\n\nOkay. You, you see a dashboard full of projects. You create a project where you say you select a channel, I\'m calling it a channel. We\'ll have to come up with something better. Um, but a channel being like an Instagram host, so 10 80 by 10 80 or an open graph image, which is like 1300 by 60, 6 30 or something like that.\n\nUm, and then we\'ve got right now just a couple of templates, um, which is a layout. And so you\'ve got a, you know, I showed you a couple of weeks ago, uh, a featured image background and a title in a footer. Um, or for the open graph, kind of what you\'d mocked up on the on slides was a logo on the left and a title on the right.\n\nUm, and so, you [00:09:00] know, using those as simple prototypes, like we will, we will spend the rest of eternity cranking out templates and refining templates, but I\'m making it so that it\'s really easy for us to make templates and then also for, um, potential customers to make their own templates, which I think is really, I think a lot of developers are going to want to do that.\n\nUm, you know. Yep. So anyway, so that\'s, that\'s all set up. Yep. Okay. Awesome. And we will, so sorry to finish the thread, we\'ve, so we\'ve, you\'ve got a screen, so it\'s like from, um, you\'re editing a blog post. There\'s a button somewhere that says, you know, OG O O M G I M G, and you open it up and there\'s all the images that you can make or will make.\n\nAssociated with that post. Um, I\'ve also added it as a link [00:10:00] in the, when you see the list of posts, you know, edit, delete, there\'s now a little om, G I m G link there for the sake of simplicity where you j it just throws you straight to the builder. Um, and then that\'s excellent. \n\nCory Miller: Just wanna say that\'s a hundred thousand percent awesome.\n\nThank you. Uh, because for those people that have a lot of content to go back and create those easily, that\'s excellent. \n\nCorey Maass: Yep. Um, and then, uh, under media, in the WordPress admin, there\'s now a new, so it\'s, you know, media library add new, and there\'s now under there there\'s a menu item that\'s om G i mg, which is, you know, site media basically.\n\nUm, and it, and again, when you click on it, it looks the same. So we may, we may wanna. Like it says Sitewide images versus the, the name of the post when you\'re in the, you know, our, our app. Um, [00:11:00] but it, it essentially looks the same. So we\'ll have to differentiate that a little bit somehow, but Okay. Um, but you go in and you say create, you know, create a new project, a new image, um, and then once you\'ve made it look the way you want, you say save as OG image.\n\nUm, and, and it\'s set. And somehow we\'ll, we\'ll denote that, that, you know, this project that you\'re looking at is currently set as the OG image, um, for your site. Thank you. Okay. \n\nCory Miller: When we get this, I was trying to look at your screenshot Slack too. Um, when we get it where you\'re ready, I\'d love to take a look and give comments there.\n\nIt\'s, I\'m, yeah. Following along I think conceptually, and then when we see all that, um, when I get to see it, I think I\'ll have better. Better help on that. Yeah. Uh, okay. Because I, if I put my post status hot hat on as a customer, [00:12:00] easily create that o OG site image that displays by default and all those things, platforms.\n\nAnd then as I\'m creating the post, I can go in and create an OG image for that post that, that nails that basic value prop for me, right. Was my post dose. \n\nCorey Maass: Yeah. And, and to me it\'s, um, I mean as much because it was the easy, easier first option. Um, like you can save as featured image, but it\'s, to me, that\'s the, that was the first problem we identified, which was, um, you know, for every blog post you want, you want, you need a featured image, but you are in the co when you\'re looking at a blog post, the featured image is, you know, a bunch of people in a [00:13:00] boardroom or a handsome person typing on a laptop.\n\nBut when you share that, you see a person typing on a laptop and it has no context to, um, you know, to the blog post. Um, so that\'s where we said, okay, you know, we want, we want, if you share it, there\'s your OG image. But also, wouldn\'t it be nice if, frankly, if the featured image had more value, As well. So, you know, so you can, you can create one image and save, set it as the featured image, which might get pulled in as the OG image.\n\nYou can set it distinctly explicitly as the OG image. They could be two different things. Um, you know, and then down the road we will have things like copy, you know, so it\'s like you create an OG image that is just the title of the blog post, but you\'ll say copy, save it at, you know, save this one as the o as the featured image, and that one has the bullet points or whatever.\n\nSo you can, [00:14:00] you know, mix and match. Again, sort of following the, I, I don\'t want to keep saying Canva, but um, you know, where it\'s like easy to go in and, and create a new image and edit and create a new image and tweak it. And um, the other thing that I just added yesterday, which is pretty slick, is you can, um, Change channels.\n\nRight? So, and this is where the responsiveness comes in that we\'ve talked about. So it\'s like if you have an image that\'s, you know, wide 16, nine or something good for a featured image, good for an OG image, excuse me, changing it to Instagram, it makes it square, you know, and it might not be perfect, but it, you know, the left and right, stay on the left and right.\n\nOr if you go to a mobile view, they go to top and bottom, um, in the same way that a website does. And all this seems to work. So. Okay, cool. \n\nCory Miller: So I think when you get it, [00:15:00] um, beta ready, I want to put it on post-test and start using it, and I think that\'ll be really good data back. Just a note on that real quick is we\'re trying to switch, we\'ve.\n\nSwitch your platform over and, um, I think by the time this is ready, I\'ll be able to put it on our new environment and, uh, and then give a lot of feedback and notes from, from using it. Uh, a lot of this I keep asking your you how this works because I think I put on this a piece of content. It\'s like, what is open graph and why should I care?\n\nMm-hmm. The marketing side, um, I, I tend to, in any project, try to embody the customer, but I am the customer here. Sure. Um, and so even as versus people might think I am on the web, I still have a ton of questions and I think that\'s gonna, so I, I\'m writing some notes as we go about some of that content stuff [00:16:00] to say, you know, um, to help people understand and make, connect the dots to ogm and Gs.\n\nThis it\'s Scraper Oak Graph plus. Just want a nice image done fast for a piece of content. We got you. \n\nCorey Maass: Yeah. Yeah. And I, I mean, you, you asking these questions like I, I, we\'ve talked a little bit about how I am a very intuitive product developer. Um, like things just occur to me as I\'m ba bashing at my keyboard.\n\nAnd so I\'m, I\'m adding things and I try to be a little disciplined about adding features and whatnot, but it\'s at, at the end of the day, You and also me, um, have to go forth and sell this and, you know, and, and as we\'ve talked about early on, like I\'m relying on you down the road to take the, the reins for setting up the marketing site and uh, marketing copy and all that kind of stuff.\n\nSo, you know, you asking questions. I mean, any, any good [00:17:00] salesman needs to know how it works, even if they\'re not, you know, explaining a, um, internal combustion engine to the, the, you know, the person trying to buy a car. They still, it helps to know how it works and be able to answer those questions because it also, it\'s gonna float to the top all of the actual value props that ultimately we\'re gonna talk about.\n\nI mean, it\'s cuz we\'re, we\'re building a really neat image builder. Okay? And, and I think people are gonna go, wow, you know, whizbang, but at the end of the day, we\'re selling it. We\'re selling value, just like anything. And so that value needs to be clear. And if people don\'t know that how important it is for when sites get shared and that, how that relates to this thing called an open graph image.\n\nAnd that\'s also part of why like, I think, um, you know, setting a good, creating a, a more valuable featured image, [00:18:00] which is something we had talked about early on too. Like, you know, just adding the title to a featured image. People don\'t realize how amazingly valuable that is because that usually is the image that gets sucked in as the default OG image if there isn\'t one explicitly set.\n\nSo, and all of these things I think are, these are, these to me are patterns. Thank you. You reminded me. I need to stand up. Um, I think all of these are patterns that we will unearth as we, as it gets used, right? Like, we\'re gonna find that a lot of people. Are setting images or are not setting images or don\'t know what, that these images should be set, you know?\n\nAnd so we, there\'s gonna be some education, but it\'s also like we, we need to just speak their language. If, if they\'re not thinking about it this way. But they are all, I mean, anybody who\'s promoting a site is in fact concerned about shareability and that kind of thing. Like, we need to understand what language they\'re using.\n\nOkay. \n\nCory Miller: [00:19:00] Um, okay, so put, I\'m gonna put on the post back, on the post set for a second. I\'m the customer and for V1 launch, um, I go AMA post hit OG image to create the, the image. Um, then from that point, I\'ve created that image. Yeah. And then I go to sh share on social. How does that work for me as customer? How, how do you it the nuts and bolts of like, Do I download image, go over to Facebook, whatever, my social platform.\n\nCorey Maass: Okay. No, not at all. And that\'s, I mean, that\'s the nice thing about this. And, but also it\'s, it, it\'s the nice thing. Technically it\'s the bad thing humanly. Um, because it, it, it\'s one of those things that just works. It\'s like, you know, people logs have r s s feeds, right? Like there is this Yeah, this big, [00:20:00] there\'s a, a file of code, it\'s plain text and it\'s just gobbledy g to your average person.\n\nUm, but that\'s how, uh, you know, an r s s feed used to be really popular for sharing blog posts, right? And that\'s still the backbone. I was, this is in my head, which is why I bring it up because I was setting up a podcast for a client this morning. Like that\'s still how podcasts work. But to most people, it\'s just magic, right?\n\nLike, You know, but you can\'t, um, you don\'t just put a piece of audio on the internet and, and it\'s a podcast. Like there\'s these, you know, this magic tech stuff that happens behind the scenes. Um, offloaded. \n\nCory Miller: Okay. So I\'ve created my post, created my OG image publish. I take that link \n\nCorey Maass: and go. I\'m sorry. So No, you do nothing.\n\nYou do nothing. So, um, if you, sorry, I was, I was talking analogously. [00:21:00] Um, in you, you know, if you look at any, if you look at the source of any website, um, then wait, \n\nCory Miller: wait, sorry. I think I know where you\'re going there. Let me pause for just one second. So my, my workflow would be we create a post on post status, um, and then we want to go out and share it.\n\nI would just do my normal thing and OG image is gonna display in Correct. Those social networks. Yeah. Okay. It\'s just, that\'s great news because I w I thought at some point, um, I was gonna have to download, go over here to, uh, tweet deck, whatever it is, or the social channel itself. Upload, put post link, get my update ready on my social post.\n\nBut that\'s all baked in. So like I just do my normal scheduling OG image is gonna appear naturally. \n\nCorey Maass: Yeah, it\'s, it, it\'s the same as if you, if you share a URL on Twitter, on Facebook, anywhere. Yeah. [00:22:00] And, and a, and a URL might or might not have any information in it, right? Like there\'s a, it\'s possible that a, you share a u r url that that is, yeah.\n\nYou know, post status.com/ 1 23. Yeah. Which means nothing to anybody. Yeah. But, um, but Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, everybody will, what they actually do behind the scenes is that, is that the computer goes and visits the website Yeah. And pulls metadata. The title tag, the metatags. So there\'s a description, there\'s a, and um, and if there isn\'t, and this is what, why the O OG images were created and all the O OG tags, open graph tags was Yeah.\n\nUh, by default. So it\'s like if you shared a U R L on Facebook, it would automatically suck in the first image it found. Well, a lot of the time, the first image it, um, it finds is a logo. Okay, fine. But if you\'re on a blog post and you wanna share the featured image, [00:23:00] you\'d have to manually go inject that.\n\nAnd so what you can do instead is you can explicitly set the open graph image, which is the image that, you know, when you paste a URL URL into Slack or into Twitter or any of it, that little preview comes up. It\'s sucking in that, that open graph info. Okay. Um, except for now, Twitter. Twitter sucks in a Twitter card info, but it\'s hidden to the average user.\n\nCory Miller: So for this part, you don\'t have to explain the plumbing necessarily, but workflow as a customer, I go, okay, I\'ve installed O M G I M G, I probably go Okay, create my default, what I think of as like my website, business card, kind of online business card. Yep. Yep. And then behind the scenes doing all that awesome magic.\n\nSo then I\'ve just helped got the previews, so like professional and visible and the search engines and all these other channels. Then post, it\'s doing that magic for me. I just go worry about [00:24:00] scheduling my link and content updates on the social platforms and these appear. So I would think as a customer, so post using Postes is our customer for a second.\n\nUm, we do Twitter and LinkedIn. Those are our two primary channels. So probably somewhere we\'re setting OG images for all the networks, but you know for sure our output for those blog posts. When I do the schedule workflow, what I do, what we do, uh, we probably wanna make sure those, that builder section is okay, create your LinkedIn version, create or tweak whatever your Twitter version.\n\nYep. And then when I go to do my normal content promotion side on the socials, it\'s all displayed magically right there. Corey, you made it effortless for me. To do that as a customer. And I mean, there we go. Cuz I was writing some messaging on that, but I just wanted to con confirm that customer workflow, so like you\'re doing [00:25:00] all the magic behind the scenes with OG stuff, but for the user it\'s like you\'ve just taken out huge amount of time, an effort that takes to go over to a canvas or fire up, Photoshop, whatever you\'re doing, and it\'s appropriately sized for each of your major channels.\n\nCorey Maass: Yep. So, uh, like I said, I mean the, the most, most channels use the same, um, you know, same image. Right. Twitter now is, uh, is a little different, but yeah, the what\'s nice and it\'s, and, and from a, from a user workflow, there\'s sort of a, a trickle down, right? Like Yeah. The first thing we\'ll have you do is we\'ll set up a Sitewide OG image, a business card like you said.\n\nSo right there, no matter what, if your site, any a any page on your site is shared, there\'s at least something better showing, or at least something predictable and something you know, truly marketable showing. [00:26:00] And then you can, and then you can get better, right? Where you can go into specific pages or posts, create images that are specific to that page.\n\nSo then you are, you know, you\'re adding icing on top of icing. And then you can go even, even further where you are, um, copying the OG image. But, um, Or a specific post or something, but then you\'re, you\'re creating a version for Instagram, because Instagram doesn\'t pull in OG images, you have to upload an image.\n\nBut we just, what we just took a co uh, an image that you know you like that\'s shaped like this and, and Z made a square out of it with, with one click. And now you\'ve, at again, you\'ve at least got a basic image to share on Instagram that, you know, will be the right size and shape and has your, your marketing assets.\n\nYou might need to tweak the logo a little bit or something, but, um, \n\nCory Miller: so if I put my mindset back in post status, we create, you know, weekly content, [00:27:00] um, and then we share on the socials. Um, I want to think for a second before I get access to the product. Um, I would want like LinkedIn and Twitter. Those are our two biggest channels.\n\nUh, I get your, you\'ve set up the response on this, which is awesome. Yeah. Um, but what would I want? I\'m, I\'m asking myself as a post customer, what would I want a display there? So I\'m really, I think I told you I\'m leaning into LinkedIn and like when I was doing that with my ma, I showed you and thank you for your helping that.\n\nCause I was like, oh, this is a great use case right here. Um, so LinkedIn, I\'d go to myself, like the, the default, some of the images that come up take way too much screen space in LinkedIn. Mm-hmm. Yep. Um, so I\'d want to say, I\'m gonna guess some kind of image featured image [00:28:00] that it\'s thematic to the content that I\'ve pulled from other source.\n\nUm, headline\n\nmaybe. Maybe that\'s it. \n\nCorey Maass: Like, well, and this is, this is what you decide, right? Like you Yeah. You know, when, when you and I were look, doing a bit of research on this, like we went and looked at WP Beginner, uh, we looked at Free\'s blog. We looked at just kind of let you know, let\'s Google some random things and see what comes up.\n\nUm, and one of the ones that we liked, um, had, you know, essentially what was their featured image on the left and the title on the right, but the whole thing was an image. And so when you shared the story, that\'s the graphic that got used. It was a, an image that was relevant, but put in context because it included the title.\n\nUm, and this is where again, like I\'m trying to build this picture of, [00:29:00] um, Hmm, I don\'t know what you call it, but how, the way that users grow with a product, right? Like the first time you buy Photoshop, you open it and you, you know, take out the power lines and you\'re like, okay, great, I\'m done. But you know, six months later you\'re adding layers and you\'re adding some text and then six months later you are, you know, tweaking the alpha channels and I\'m trying to think of what other, using masks and embedded objects and all this stuff.\n\nLike you, you grow with a product. And so for us, The immediate value people are gonna install this thing. We\'re gonna walk you through ba building a business card for your website and, and right there if nothing else, you know your, your website\'s gonna be represented better anytime that it\'s shared. And then you can, and then you can build business cards for specific posts and pages.\n\nSo it\'s getting more and more relevant and, and more and more valuable to be shared. And then past that you\'re going, okay, well I actually, every time I create a blog post, [00:30:00] I wanna, you know, I can, I can share this on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and it\'ll suck in that OG image, but I can\'t do that on Instagram.\n\nI need a dedicated image. Yeah. So you\'d say click copy, you know, change it from og, change the channel from OG Image to Instagram. Whoop, it\'s square. You download and you upload. Cuz you have to do it, you have to manually do it with Instagram. So, you know, but we\'ve, we\'ve, you are now, every time you create a post, There\'s a default OG image, then there\'s an OG image relevant to the post.\n\nAnd then it\'s with a couple of clicks. You\'ve got images that are specifically sized for other channels like Instagram. And then down the road you\'re like, like we talked about, we\'re like, oh, we want, you know, if I\'m really pushing hard on a blog post, I want slides, I want numerous different images cuz I\'m gonna tweet about this every day for a week.\n\nAnd I don\'t want to keep using the same image. So I\'m gonna copy, paste, copy or, or copy, copy, copy. And I\'m gonna say, use these [00:31:00] three bullets on Monday. Use this pull quote on Tuesday, da, da, da. And download all of those five images. And so now it\'s like, again, as you grow with the product, you\'re gonna just bang, bang, bang, you\'re with any piece of content you create, like your blog post, you\'re gonna have five images, 10 images that all have specific purposes.\n\nUm, and if you are just a site owner, if you\'re just one person, You do the basic, you do what you\'ve got time for. But if you\'re like one of my clients that has a dedicated social media manager, they\'re going to own this tool. They\'re gonna become a pro with this tool, and they\'re gonna be generating a dozen images for every post because they\'re wheeling and dealing.\n\nCory Miller: And that part is what I was just trying to think, ask myself, okay, uh, I want this to show up. I\'ve now, I\'ve got an easy way to do it. And I was just trying to do a little bit of thought about what would be valuable to me when I am, I\'ve done all this work, and now I want it to be an [00:32:00] image that kind of entices someone to come back to the content.\n\nUm, at a base, I\'d want to say, you know, there\'s an image, kind of some of those templates we saw, middle part logo, maybe the featured images in the background are like top five accessibility firms and WordPress, you know, and, um, with, with the brand. On this, on that image, I think would be the minimum things I\'d want for any post that we did like.\n\nSo we do just kinda right side of this when we get to this for the template phases. Um, so we have two columns, basically three I guess business, tech and community. And you know, we do a tech every week and it\'s like, that\'s probably not a good example here, but, uh, something interesting in tech, I\'ll say it like this, maybe this is a good example.\n\nWe do a make word WordPress column every week that [00:33:00] summarizes links off to things happening on the project. So she always does a title on there. So it\'d probably be series name this this week at Make WordPress. And her title, and it would just be like 6.2 campaign release, Gutenberg project updates or something actionable.\n\nYep. But it\'s branded as that this week column idea. I hadn\'t thought about that with this product, but I go, that\'s probably good. Like this week in pro, these three happens. And right there with the title, they\'re kind of going, okay, I ne I\'ve already got value. I\'m gonna click through and see what is in that post.\n\nAnd then Michelle does a, a column me tweak. So, you know, might be whatever her column title is. Um, trying to think once you did last podcast, sequels community or something like that. So it\'d be title, [00:34:00] category, title, this, it\'s her, her community section, whatever we call it. Then whatever her headline is, So they know like, click here.\n\nThis is the magic package to get more. So I think that\'s probably, I think that works. I was trying to test it out and just say, what would my minimum request be from, from you when you\'re building it. \n\nCorey Maass: Sure. So, you know, we haven\'t introduced, I haven\'t introduced like saving templates yet, but you\'d, you\'d, another way to approach this is you\'d create a template that has the post status logo on the left and some piece of text on the right, right.\n\nYeah. And then you\'d save that, um, for, as a, as an overall template. And so Michelle goes in and creates a community [00:35:00] post, let\'s say. Yeah. And so she says, use the standard template post status logo automatically on the left. It sucks in the title of her. Her post that week on the right. Okay. Corey, who\'s in charge of the tech at this point?\n\nYou, uh, yeah, me, I guess. Me. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um, you know, Corey goes in and creates a tech column this week. You know, use the standard, the standard, uh, template, post status image on the left, you know, this week in tech on the right. Um, now if you, uh, take this further, right, you could, um, automatically, you know, or, or Michelle creates a sort of a sub template that, so it says post status image, it says community, and then her title.\n\nAnd week over week, the, the logo stays the same. The word community stays the same, but the title changes. You know, week, [00:36:00] the week of April 12th. In, in commu in WordPress community, the week of April 5th, WordPress community. The other one over here says Post status logo tech, and then your title, right? Um, so that\'s one per column.\n\nYou also put out a newsletter if that newsletter is a post. Essentially, it doesn\'t matter if you\'re putting out a newsletter. The newsletter has a make section, a text section, a community section. So every time you create a newsletter, you would create three images, you know, taking that original saved template and just say, copy paste, copy paste, copy paste, hashtag community, hashtag make hashtag tech.\n\nPut in a few, you know, bullet points and then you download that as the okay. This week we put out our newsletter and then we also have three shareable images. And so as the newsletter comes out on Friday, on Monday you, [00:37:00] you tweet about the tech one and you use the tech image, you tweet about the, the, the make one and you use the make image.\n\nAnd so it\'s just automat, you know, makes it very easy to over and over and over create a whole bunch of images that are used in whatever way makes sense for you. Yeah, okay.\n\nCory Miller: So I was trying to use that to think it through and I think it broadened it out a little bit. So I would want maybe like a series category thing.\n\nI was trying to think this, cause I was like, next step I want to do some actual templates to mock this up a little bit. Mm-hmm. That\'d be great. So up here that sets up like a top here. Lemme do this.\n\nSo if this is the card, I\'d probably [00:38:00] want\n\ndo the make work, press something conceptually up here that\'s like, Hey, this is the category content. Like we have just like your magazine client has numerous topics, uh, categories. We would have something like that. Okay. And then headline. Um, I think an option to go.\n\nWhich might be the excerpt.[00:39:00] \n\nYeah, I was thinking like, let me actually pull this. God. Oh my God. Okay, so you get it? Yeah.\n\nWhile we\'re moving our hosting environment. This, come on. Okay. Anyway, so where am I at?\n\nJust wanna work this through, cause I think this is, uh, So Gutenberg 6.2 candidates, uh, feedback needed. Trying to put it in an actual thing. I\'m gonna remember. Okay. So series up here, like they\'re kind of having this expectation. This is a category, topical content. We could even create [00:40:00] different backgrounds like we do in our newsletter, different sections.\n\nTech has blue. I can\'t remember the colors offhand. Um, and then we\'d probably want some kind of logo, branded logo. Yep.\n\nI just put here Freeflow just because like maybe a lot of this is only the headline make it mm-hmm. Peeling to the headline. But if they wanted something like, you know,\n\nPutting my content hat on here. Um, that would just give a free flow area join, you know? \n\nCorey Maass: Yeah. Join the conversation. Feedback needed. Join the conversation. And this is, and this is where, so you might create a template that says, um, that, that has, [00:41:00] has a hard coded title in the left serious title Make WP never gonna change, right?\n\nSo when you created this template, you\'d go in and type that in. But in the middle is a variable, right? Is a placeholder. And so when any, anytime you created a new newsletter or a new whatever, you\'d say, copy that template. And that placeholder automatically sucks in the name of the blog post and your free flowing text.\n\nIt might automatically suck in the excerpt from the blog post. Now you can then go in and, and edit it, overwrite it, change it, you know. But, but at, at the, the minimum, if you\'ve created a template and then said, um, it\'s kind of like a page builder, right? Like, I use Beaver Builder, so I have a, I have page templates like use a, this, you know, header and content template [00:42:00] for any page that I create.\n\nAnd so I create a new page and right away it has a header up here and the content down here. But then I say, well, I really want this two, this one page. I really want it two columns, or I want to add a form. Then I go in and I tweak it, you know, to be specific to that page. But when I\'ve initially created the page, that template gets applied.\n\nIt sucks in the header, it sucks in the content. And right away I\'ve got a branded page. You know, with no effort. I\'ve, I\'ve created that template once and now creating every subsequent page, just, it\'s just formatted the way I want it to be. Yeah. \n\nCory Miller: I, I\'m doing this not necessarily for marketing, but for more the template functionality, like, cause what I want to do is get these little things here.\n\nMm-hmm. Put in enough. Uh, sample content and have someone do a treatment, you know, create our templates because I know if this is [00:43:00] attractive, it\'s gonna like, in an impactful and useful, it\'s gonna be really different. But I could be like, okay, so designer for the template, you know, think of the background option.\n\nWe\'ve already done some of this. Like we\'d want to say, you know, tagline for us would be,\n\num, or something like that. We\'d want the logo here to kind of brand that image. But primary thing is like, this happened, we connected to some topic that\'s of interest to our users. And like in that social update and LinkedIn, up here in the text copy is, you know, a summary. But right there they\'re like Gutenberg something that hits that category.\n\nThey see it\'s branded. We get some brand awareness with the logo, the business we\'re doing this for. Um,\n\nyep, man, I like that. [00:44:00] Um, so that was for me more for the template side of things and just playing around this cuz I, if we nail this, um, people are gonna be like, how\'d you do it? \n\nCorey Maass: I love that you\'re, you can\'t stop tweaking. You\'re like, logo on the left, no logo on the right. No logo on the center tagline.\n\nYeah, because I \n\nCory Miller: know if we can get this looking really nice, people are gonna, how\'d you do that? Well, it\'s this plugin called \n\nCorey Maass: Om, G I M G. Um, um, yeah, I mean, I think I, I, I think the, you know, the, these little mockups that you keep doing are great. I think you, instead of like, Instead of logo on the left, and then you move it, I think you duplicate the page and move the logo.\n\nAnd then these are all templates that we will create, or, you know, we will, if, if most of them are similar or if, you know, three of them are similar, but you\'ve got logo left, right, center, [00:45:00] then uh, you know, then I make that a little toggle that says, do you want your logo in the, you know, which corner do you want your logo in?\n\nOr, or that kind of thing. Um, so we do need, do you have, do you have a designer that you work with? \n\nCory Miller: Yeah. \n\nCorey Maass: Um, maybe. Sort of. Kinda. I do, I do. Um, well, just so we need, I mean, right now we find ourselves needing two things. One, we need a logo for this plugin overall. Um, and then, you know, so if, and then it would be great to have somebody, like you said, like if we give them essentially what you\'re doing as wire frames, um, and say, You know, here\'s what we need.\n\nDo some, do some designs. And then I go and I actually h t mli HT mli them, you know, make them actual templates. Then, you know, and we start with three that are very distinct. You know, the dark theme, the [00:46:00] light theme, and the rainbow theme or whatever, um, you know, that use different fonts and different treatments.\n\nAnd one is, you know, emphasizes the title and one emphasizes the logo and one emphasizes, you know, the business card or whatever. Then those could be the first three templates that we, we start with. Yeah. So that\'s kind of what I\'m thinking. Yeah. \n\nCory Miller: I like using this sample. Like we def I think we need something up above, whether it\'s centered, whatever, you know, the toggle button.\n\nYep. I kind of like, this is the topic. Um, See, I, I can give this right now to the designer. Like this is the headline. Yep. Um, freeflow. Yeah.[00:47:00] \n\nYeah. See that\'s really big. See that? We got that. So we need something there like an upper. Mm-hmm. Can\'t remember what they called it in the newspapers, but it\'s the category name or just a generic text area \n\nCorey Maass: here. Right. The section of the newspaper. You\'re in news, you\'re in auto, you\'re in classifieds, you\'re in, I don\'t remember what it\'s called.\n\nYeah.\n\nCory Miller: Yeah. See, this is good too because, you know, they clipped that stuff and you do too much text. So like \n\nCorey Maass: Right. But they don\'t clip images, so that if that image had your, your headline, you know, and, and I mean, it\'s exactly what we\'re talking about. Like, you\'ve got the image, you\'ve got an image treatment. And so again, like if you create that once in om G I M G, which by the way, abbreviates to OI or ooi, [00:48:00] which I like, um, so, uh, in ooi, uh, or oi, um, nice.\n\nInstead of ai, we are oi. Um, okay. But, uh, you know, there\'s that background image, right? That black and white faded into the back background image. So you know, that could automatically be your featured image. So every time you create a blog post, a featured image appears in the black, in the background in black and white.\n\nYou know, with, with a mostly black layer over the top of it. So you\'ve got a text, essentially a textured background automatically generated, but from the featured image of every post. And then it has the headline in orange or white over the top and your logo in the top left done, essentially auto-generated for every blog post you create.\n\nSo, \n\nCory Miller: like\n\nI was trying to flesh this out for the design and whoever we hand this off [00:49:00] to. So this right here is an OG image, I guess, cuz it\'s pulling in this text. \n\nCorey Maass: Not necessarily The text is pulled in from, you know, either, either a meta description or an OG description tag cuz there\'s, you know, in, in old school html, there was a bunch of meta tags.\n\nThere\'s title description, there was a tags tag, so you used to put in keywords and you know, but people would, would abuse that. And so they took that out. And so again, now OG Open Graph has the similar tags where you\'ve got author description image, so this, so here they, they could be pulled in from a couple of different things.\n\nAnd then that image again is coming from, it\'s either the featured image or, yeah, it\'s the, it\'s the OG image. \n\nCory Miller: Okay, so I get this, we got that. We\'re creating that with OMG here [00:50:00] though it just made me think like, what if we wanted, you know, Yost has its own SEO compliance stuff. This just made me think is like, I wonder, this could be downstream roadmap wise, but I\'ll let them tweak what the open graph is.\n\nThis text. \n\nCorey Maass: At that point we say install Yost. Like I don\'t, I, to me we wanna be a image generating plugin. Not an SEO plugin,\n\nCory Miller: but like when she posts whoever did this Yep. When she posts this link, um, here, it pulled in the image, cuz I know this is a created image. Yep. It\'s the featured image of the post. And this comes from Yost. Cause that\'s what we got on the site. \n\nCorey Maass: [00:51:00] Yep.\n\nSo at least to tweak that if she wanted to update it is in Yost. \n\nCory Miller: So, okay. When we do the design, Templates. We need to factor in that. Like mo like LinkedIn for instance. I\'m sure the others are gonna pull in this data. Yeah. That like really I need to tell the designer. Remember like LinkedIn, however else it shows, there\'s gonna be this pulled in.\n\nSo there might not be like I was doing tagline and everything, uh, on the image. Maybe it\'s just the logo. Like, like mm-hmm. She\'s got here. Um, and we don\'t worry about all that tagline stuff cuz like it\'s right here. Right.\n\nOkay.[00:52:00] \n\nRight. Because I\'m getting, I\'m thinking, uh, I know how to clear that now.\n\nCorey Maass: Um. \n\nCory Miller: Okay, so for design we need the logo.\n\nWe need some basic, we need a single post. And then I\'m just trying to flesh out what to get the designer so they know the elements they have to work with.\n\nLike they just need to know that\'s the frame. [00:53:00] Yep.\n\nSo does Designwise, do you. Do you have somebody you wanna work with? I have somebody we can work with that I think would give us good start, give us a lot of variations. Mm-hmm. Options. Yeah. \n\nCorey Maass: I mean, I think, I don\'t have anybody offhand. Um, we can, you know, and, and I\'ve created now two templates that are dead simple.\n\nUm, but, you know, I, I\'m conflicted. We d we need a logo. Um, and if that sets us up, like if we\'ve got somebody that, that can, can, can get us one, great. Um, you know, I have no problem jumping on fiber. I\'ve done that before many times. Um, and then ideally, yeah, we\'ve got a. A relationship that we start to build because it\'s like we want, you [00:54:00] know, one or two templates to start with.\n\nWe could even start with like the post status template essentially, so that you\'re using it and then, and then you\'re like, well, we really, it would be great if we had a different version that was, you know, totally different. And it\'s like, okay, well then, you know, that\'s two. Um, but if somebody, if we\'re working with a designer who\'s got a sense of what can be done and what we\'re looking for, um, you know, then they can just start cranking them out.\n\nLike once we\'re ready to do that, you know, cuz it\'s like, we want, we want 10 and then we want a hundred, and then we want, you know, different ones specifically for different channels, you know? Yeah. Instagram, square, whatever. Um, some are gonna be, you know, really only relevant to a sitewide and some are really only gonna be relevant to a specific post.\n\nUm, You know, and then also along the way, like, we\'re I what I, what\'s that? [00:55:00] I was coughing, sorry. Oh, sorry. Um, what I\'d benefit from is, um, somebody saying, basically showing me a bunch of different treatments by creating a number of different templates. And I\'m gonna be like, oh, right, like a gradient, you know, coming up from the bottom that\'s black to transparent, so that when the text is on the bottom, it stands out more.\n\nOr, um, you know, we add a little gradient builder and so people can design their own gradients to use as backgrounds or if we want, um, you know, if people want text that has, you\'ve seen text that\'s like, uh, changes color, you know, like as a rainbow across the text. It\'s like, oh, right. I, you know, like, let\'s figure out how to do that treatment.\n\nAnd so it\'s like we will benefit not only from very specific designs, but also just conceptually like, oh, here\'s a, a treatment that we can add to text or we can add to images that we hadn\'t thought of before. Let\'s look at ad, you [00:56:00] know, adding those as options.\n\nCory Miller: Okay, let me take Post Status as our base. And I think \n\nCorey Maass: that\'s the way to start.\n\nYeah. Work with \n\nCory Miller: this stuff to, uh, with a designer to create some, show \'em back. You let them kind of like have a little bit of wildness just a little bit and then you go, okay, I need this better. I need that. What, what\'s this? Like, you know, you put us back in the container of what can be done. Mm-hmm. I think I have everything you need that I can do with post TEUs.\n\nUh, this comment here is just Emily\'s creating those in Canvas. So I want to just touch base with her before I talk to the designer. Like, Hey, as you create these, like she\'s, she does that all the time for content journey. Um, so let me take that and let me start on that. Work with designer. Um, give you those options back and you tell me n I need that, what about this?\n\nAnd then I can go back and I [00:57:00] really think that\'s gonna be great. Where, cuz if we, like you said, if we do it for posts, why I kind of put this hat on, like really embodying, um, I want this to show up professional in some of the things you\'ve seen. I\'ve been trying to, in the next brand version of post test, make it a different, uh, design a little bit more lighter.\n\nAnd so I just wanna connect those dots too. And then, um, I\'ll get those as soon as I can over to you to give feedback back what you need better. Oh, wrong proportions. Something like, whatever that is. Yeah, that\'s perfect. Thanks for letting me do that. Cause that was helping me flesh out what I need to go ask for.\n\nCorey Maass: Yep. Yep. And I think if we start with yours, like there\'s no reason that that can\'t be, you know, at the end of the day, it\'s, it\'s not, it\'s unique because of the image treatment of, because of the orange on black. But if it was green on yellow, then that\'s somebody else\'s brand, and so it\'s still [00:58:00] all reusable.\n\nCory Miller: Okay. Last thing I didn\'t ask is ratios. \n\nCorey Maass: Yep. We need do, do, do, do, do. Where is it? How badly did I break this thing? Doesn\'t matter.\n\n1200 by six 30.\n\nIs that the default OG image? That\'s the default OG image. And it\'s, it\'s technically, it\'s not 16, nine. It\'s. 1.91 to one, but that doesn\'t matter. Just do 1200 by six 30. That\'s, that\'s the image we want.\n\nPerfect.[00:59:00] \n\nCory Miller: Okay. That\'s great. We\'ll walk on that.\n\nCorey Maass: Um, now how many, how many thousands of dollars are we gonna charge for this? Is that one of the decisions you want? 10,000, a hundred thousand? Yep. Um, no, but I do think, I think we should start thinking about it. Um, we, you had been tasked with doing some, um, competitive analysis and so, um, I think start thinking about, we can either talk about it, um, we should probably wrap up here shortly, but you know, next call next week or another call in between, but start making those kinds of decisions.\n\nCuz I think if we are deciding that we are launching with a pro version, like I wanna already start plugging some of that stuff in. Um, it\'s just things I can get ahead of while we\'re, um, [01:00:00] you know, waiting on graphics or if I\'m, um, stuck on something else, you know, because I\'ll plug in Ed D\'s class that manages licensing and then, and all that stuff and just get that set up prior to that.\n\nSo. Okay. Sorry I didn\'t discussion to a discussion to have a discussion. \n\nCory Miller: Yeah, I didn\'t do the pricing cuz I was probably thinking to myself that\'s the faster conversation. But let me, let me go back and do that cause I\'ll try to hit you with that. I think we discussed some of that in Slack. So I\'ll, I\'ll review that and just kind of look at some of these other competitors.\n\nUm, I\'ll get working on the post status templates. Um,\n\nCorey Maass: cool. Yeah, I, I, I appreciate you talking all this stuff through. I know I\'m throwing a lot of abstraction at you. [01:01:00] I\'m, I\'m, of course living in it, and, and then I\'m dropping you into, in, into the barrel with me and, and going, you know, okay, here\'s how everything works. And, and you haven\'t actually really seen much yet.\n\nSo my expectation is, yeah, within the next week or something, you\'ve actually got buttons to click on, you know, screens to look at, and, um, and it\'ll, I think it\'ll immediately become clear what\'s, what\'s missing, what\'s needed, what\'s gonna work, and what isn\'t. Okay. \n\nCory Miller: And now vice versa. Uh, and I took some notes here.\n\nUm, from my perspective, it\'s always user flow and messaging. Um, but today I really, the user flow was good for me to know. Now I understand what I need to go make at post at this. So I, I\'ll see Emily probably in the next hour anyway, and I\'ll, I\'ll talk her, I\'ll talk through this with her. Like [01:02:00] she\'s creating these all day, every day.\n\nShe can probably share some templates and then I\'ll reengage the designer. I\'m thinking for this, that would give us some options. \n\nCorey Maass: That\'d be great. And pricing. \n\nCory Miller: Roger that, dude. Awesome. \n\nCorey Maass: I love it. This is awesome. Yeah. I\'m, I\'m psyched. Like the, the deeper I dig into this and the more I play with it, the more I\'m like, you know, I\'m still, uh, I\'m still very much in the laboratory, but, you know, seeing, seeing, laying the groundwork, seeing how it\'s all wired together and seeing the potential for how we can build it out, I, and I\'m really excited.\n\nI think there\'s, there\'s a lot of amazing things we can do here. Cool. \n\nCory Miller: I\'ll let you know how that session goes. I\'m gonna co-work with them, the peop that my marketing assistant and content training that does all this type of work. So I get some intel back for us and, uh, rock on.</pre>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2023 13:28:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cory Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"Do The Woo Community: Do the Woo Friday Show with Rob Cairns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://dothewoo.io/do-the-woo-friday-show-with-rob-cairns/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:427:\"<p>Rob joins me today and wants to chat about how you should still make money building products and services even if you are using a free open source tool. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/do-the-woo-friday-show-with-rob-cairns/\">Do the Woo Friday Show with Rob Cairns</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2023 09:22:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"Post Status: WordPress Products in the Enterprise with Crowd Favorite-Post Status Draft\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149232\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-products-in-the-enterprise-with-crowd-favorite-post-status-draft/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62265:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">In this episode, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> talks with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karimmarucchi?lang=en\">Karim Marucchi</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pat_ramsey/\">Pat Ramsey</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_al_esc\">Alex Nitu</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crowdfavorite\">Crowd Favorite</a>.

They also talk about the future of WordPress and the impact of emerging technologies on the platform. Overall, the speakers highlight the need for continuous learning and adaptation in the rapidly changing world of WordPress development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"video\" class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<li><strong>Freedom for Growth. </strong>One of the benefits of WordPress at the enterprise level is its customization and flexibility. It allows enterprises to build a site that is tailored to their specific needs and requirements. Another important aspect of WordPress at the enterprise level is its ability to integrate with other enterprise tools and systems. This can include tools for content management, customer relationship management, analytics, and more. By integrating with these tools, enterprises can streamline their workflows and improve their overall efficiency to maximize growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Connection is the WordPress Way. </strong>WordPress has a large and active community of users, developers, and designers. Networking with other professionals and participating in the community can help you learn from others, stay informed about industry trends, and build valuable relationships. As a WordPress professional, building and maintaining strong relationships with your clients is key. This involves not only delivering quality work but also communicating effectively, being responsive, and understanding their needs and goals. By doing so, you can build a loyal client base and generate repeat business.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mindset Matters. </strong>By practicing mindfulness, you can learn to observe your thoughts and emotions without judgment, which can help you develop greater self-awareness and emotional resilience. Cultivating a growth mindset can help you overcome challenges and achieve your goals. By focusing on learning and development rather than fixed abilities, you can approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to learn, which can help you persevere through difficult times and ultimately achieve success.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background is-layout-flex wp-container-5\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/a2-hosting\">A2 Hosting</a></h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.

eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: [00:00:00] Hey everybody. Welcome back to Post Status Draft . This is gonna be a<br />great conversation. One I&#8217;ve been wanting to have as I&#8217;ve learned and explored more about<br />WordPress on the enterprise. And so this is under our agency, kind of both agency series and<br />product. Cuz it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s both because of what our, uh, the three people that are here today do,<br />uh, full-time for crowd favorite.<br />Um, but so we&#8217;re gonna be talking about WordPress enterprise products. I spent, uh, my career<br />in WordPress building. Products, not me personally, but leading a team that built products. But it<br />was different from the enterprise base as I told these gentlemen, they know very well. Um, that&#8217;s<br />whole different set of, um, Product uses and customers and needs, frankly.<br />So we had a product that had, was on the repo and had a million installs. That&#8217;s way different<br />product than what we&#8217;re talking about today, which is why I wanted to have this conversation. I<br />want to have more of [00:01:00] these WordPress on the enterprise conversations because I<br />think it&#8217;s so critical to WordPress overall.<br />Um, for years. Friends like Kreme, who I&#8217;ll introduce in just a second. Um, Have done this cool<br />work and I get to, and members of post status get to brag about my friends that do these cool<br />sites, that everybody knows what they are and I go, that&#8217;s about as much as I know. I know they<br />use WordPress. I know these are awesome people building for it.<br />And these are brand names that you know. So anyway, I&#8217;m excited for this conversation. Um, so<br />I have my dear friends, Karim and Pat, who I&#8217;ve known for, I don&#8217;t know, 10 plus years, and my<br />newest friend Alex, who I get to meet all from Crowd favorite. Uh, but I&#8217;m gonna let you all<br />introduce yourself. Um, Karim, I know your background go is vast.<br />Even before WordPress, you were doing some cool things in business that you took over when<br />you started, um, your agency, way back in the day before, it was called Craft Favorite. But I&#8217;m<br />gonna let you introduce yourself. All that to say it&#8217;s gonna be a fun [00:02:00] conversation<br />today.<br />Karim Marucchi: Corey, thank you so much.<br />It&#8217;s an absolute pleasure to be here. Uh, I love hanging out with you and having these<br />conversations with you because they&#8217;re amazing. Um, You mentioned I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve been around<br />since before WordPress. Yeah. Uh, at the end of this year, I&#8217;ll be, I&#8217;ll be celebrating my 30th year<br />of delivering c m s solutions for the enterprise.<br />That&#8217;s been way too long.<br />Uh, I&#8217;ve only been in the WordPress space for about 13 years. I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve found open source like<br />you find religion and I love it. Um, it&#8217;s been the best thing for our enterprise clients. So I&#8217;m CEO<br />of Crowd Favorite. Um, just for those of you who don&#8217;t have a, a deep WordPress history.<br />Crowd favorite was founded by Alex King. Um, one of the first contributors to the WordPress<br />project after, uh, Matt and Mike, um, and crowd favorite, uh, under the leadership of Alex King,<br />really did some of the [00:03:00] first big scaling publishing sites, um, in the WordPress world.<br />So we are proud to carry that name forward today.<br />Cory Miller: You know, you mentioned Alex and when I was a, just using WordPress in 2006,<br />when you install it, this is how far Alex and Cry favorite go back to is. You know, you install<br />WordPress, you get a blog roll by default. There&#8217;d be a bunch of names. You&#8217;re like, oh, who&#8217;s<br />all these names? Yeah. But there&#8217;s always Alex on there and, uh, I got to meet Alex in 2010 and<br />then I was excited when you all joined forces.<br />And became crowd favorite cuz what you&#8217;re doing in the space too. I think I met you right about<br />2011 maybe Karim. I mean, it was pretty early. Yeah. And I was like, who&#8217;s this guy who is, is,<br />uh, knows his stuff and quite charming And, uh, that led to, I don&#8217;t know, gosh, has it been like<br />hundreds of times we&#8217;ve had dinner together and, uh, Stopped by during Covid and got to hang<br />out on the back porch as you&#8217;re [00:04:00] going across the country.<br />Uh, and then, and of course, right on the tails of Karim is Pat, who I&#8217;ve known just as long so,<br />and excited when Pat was a part of Crowd favorite as well. But Pat, uh, could you introduce<br />yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pat Ramsey: Yeah, uh, Pat Ramsey, uh, director of Technology here at Crowd Favorite. Um,<br />I&#8217;ve been here a little over eight years, but, um, I was scratching my brain there because I think<br />it was Word Camp Dallas 2009 when I met you and your team Corey, um, back in the day there<br />at, uh, I think it was UT Dallas at that conference center that was there.<br />That&#8217;s right. Yeah. Yeah. And you were showing, you know, you guys were, you guys were doing<br />all of the theme work on the back end where it was all user configurable. Uh, and, uh, I had a<br />very, uh, it was a short but intense conversation with one of your devs about the pros and cons<br />of doing that and allowing that on the back end versus not.<br />Um, here we are now still, so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s fantastic. [00:05:00] Um, you mentioned that, uh, Alex King<br />showing up on the blog roll. It was 2005 or 6 . And, uh, he answered one of my support<br />questions on WordPress back then. Um, and I remember seeing him in that, uh, I think it was<br />that, that old green blocky looking default theme, uh mm-hmm.<br />And being in that sidebar. So that was, uh, that was fun.<br />Cory Miller: Gosh, I, so Karim Pat predates our friendship.<br />Karim Marucchi: It does, it does. Pat is one of the, the OG WordPress people in the<br />community.<br />Cory Miller: Absolutely. That was a good time. I do remember that. That was historic time for us<br />too, because we were doing Ithe builder at the time, I think is what you&#8217;re talking about.<br />Yep. That was Then if you&#8217;ll remember real quick piece of nostalgia, Alex and everybody else,<br />um, uh, that Deb, you&#8217;re talking about Christine, who, who&#8217;s now automatic. Came to me and he<br />goes, Hey, I just met this 16 year old kid doing some incredible stuff, like mind blowing. I was<br />like, Chris, you&#8217;re one of [00:06:00] the smartest people I know, so you&#8217;re telling me somebody I<br />gotta go meet this person.<br />It was Clay Griffiths of Headway themes. So that was a historic one for us too, in your<br />friendship. All right, thanks Pat. Alex.<br />Alex Nitu: The new kid bringing up their year.<br />Cory Miller: My newest friend. Yes.<br />Alex Nitu: Yeah. So I&#8217;m Alex Nitu . I&#8217;m a product manager at Crowd Favorite. Um, I&#8217;m always<br />been a techie ever since I was a little. That millennial, millennial generation that just grew up<br />with, uh, computers and the internet developing as I did.<br />Um, and so yeah, I bounced around between startups, government agencies, uh, boutique<br />agencies until I finally found God favorite. And that was really, uh, a kismet moment that I&#8217;ve, I<br />felt like I found my tribe. I&#8217;m like, yep. These are the, the guys that I&#8217;m gonna build great things<br />with. Uh, and so yeah, now I&#8217;m super passionate about open source and, uh, what, uh, what<br />we&#8217;re building, uh, [00:07:00] at our favorite.<br />I think it&#8217;s, uh, very interesting and can&#8217;t wait to share it with you and everybody else.<br />Cory Miller: Absolutely. Well, I got to meet Alex last week and he showed me the product<br />they&#8217;re working on and I was really impressed and particularly his passion and vision for what,<br />what he&#8217;s doing with the product. So, nice.<br />Okay. Thanks for sharing a little bit about yourselves. Let&#8217;s dive right into the topic, which is<br />WordPress Enterprise Products. Um, like I say, Karim, this is compelling to me because I&#8217;ve<br />always been proud of. An envious of my friends that operate in the enterprise space, but I just<br />go, I don&#8217;t even know what it&#8217;s like to work like with some of the huge companies I know you all<br />work with.<br />Mm-hmm. Um, but I know your passion for open source, the open web, and down to Word<br />Press, paired with vast experience working with these huge companies. So when we&#8217;re talking<br />about WordPress products in the enterprise, what comes to your mind? Why are we even<br />talking about this? I think I know what I&#8217;m, why we&#8217;re talking about it, but I&#8217;m curious to know<br />your [00:08:00] perspective on this.<br />Karim Marucchi: Yeah, so the biggest, the biggest difference when I talk to folks who&#8217;ve come<br />over from the, from the comer world, is less than 10% of enterprise software products. I&#8217;m not<br />talking about SaaS, I&#8217;m talking about software products. Less than 10% of software products for<br />the enterprise are turnkey. You install them, you hand over an interface and they just use it.<br />Most are what we call an 80% solution. Um, a great example of this was even, um, in, in the<br />early days of Crowd favorite, um, Alex King released a product called ramp, which was for<br />moving content from one complex environment to another, and they could never get that last<br />interface right, because in the enterprise, everybody&#8217;s workflow is so different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that you have to customize that last 20% on every install. [00:09:00] So even though this<br />sounds crazy, in the comer world, we&#8217;re building products that we are just doing 80% of the<br />product, and then we may install it 3, 4, 5 times, not 5,000 or 6,000, but those three, four or five<br />times, it&#8217;s a custom installation each time.<br />It&#8217;s a custom process. That&#8217;s the best.<br />Cory Miller: So, Yeah. And, and I know from talking to you in the past about that, that I, you<br />know, the comer type products we released, you go, okay, it&#8217;s mostly one s fits all, you know?<br />Mm-hmm. There&#8217;s edge cases that&#8217;s not gonna work. But on the enterprise presents a whole<br />different set of, um, challenges I&#8217;m sure.<br />So I get that too. And where the needs are just really vastly different and need that kind of<br />customization. You mentioned something that&#8217;s interesting to me. You said software product<br />versus SaaS. Mm-hmm. So te tell me that distinction because there&#8217;s one I just picked up on. I<br />go, okay. I need to dig into that one [00:10:00] because that&#8217;s different.<br />I, I, I understand software versus SaaS, but on the enterprise perspective.<br />Karim Marucchi: Well, on the enterprise perspective, you absolutely have SAS products that<br />are ready to go, uh, more likely than not, though. Even large software implementations that you<br />expect to be sas. If you&#8217;re an enterprise that has enough money, you&#8217;re getting your own custom<br />version of even that SaaS product.<br />But you know, there&#8217;s Salesforce, there&#8217;s uh, HubSpot, there&#8217;s a lot of products out there that<br />they, they promote the fact that they have an enterprise product that&#8217;s just, you log in and you<br />go. But reality of the top tier of enterprise is that they want whatever product they&#8217;re using to be<br />adapted to their workflow.<br />Yes, so that&#8217;s why we make a distinction. Sometimes there are plug and place SAS for the<br />enterprise, and then there&#8217;s also just the traditional sort of software architecture where you have<br />to do this last 20%. [00:11:00] And then there&#8217;s what Alex and our team is playing with right now.<br />We&#8217;ve been working on, uh, personalization products for about six years now for our clients<br />directly, and each time they&#8217;re different.<br />But we started playing around with progressive profiling and, uh, conditional content, all these<br />types of concepts. So we started releasing in a public, uh, in a, in a, uh, plugin on the repository,<br />just some of the codes to play with. First it was on GitHub, then we moved to repository, and<br />now lately we&#8217;ve been trying to see what does it look like to actually hook up some of these APIs<br />to third parties.<br />And actually try to create a little bit more of a standardized product. But still we&#8217;re finding that<br />the customers who are enterprise clients will download our um, D X P toolkit product, the free<br />version from the repository. Then they&#8217;ll contact us and they&#8217;ll say, we need X, Y, Z<br />customizations, and it ends up being something that [00:12:00] is completely custom for that<br />client.<br />Cory Miller: See, I&#8217;ll hold this question, but that, that presents a whole different, it feels like<br />pricing monitor from b2c, which is, Hey, buy this. Good to go. Um, but I&#8217;ll save that for later on in<br />the conversation. Um, but I&#8217;m curious, I know you&#8217;ve told me too, this is the next frontier. Or<br />WordPress. Mm-hmm. Um, in the enterprise specifically, but you&#8217;re seeing things and, and even<br />if you&#8217;ve been working on these things for six years, I know you&#8217;ve been talking about it since<br />we&#8217;ve met.<br />Right. Uh, because we, we tried to figure out, okay, you know, this space, we do products. How<br />do, how do we do this? You&#8217;ve been thinking, working on these things for a long time, but you&#8217;re<br />obviously seeing things. What are you seeing out there, the opportunities, uh, I&#8217;m sure through<br />your actual enterprise clients.<br />Karim Marucchi: So the, the largest opportunity we&#8217;re seeing is clients pushing the limits of<br />what their expectations are with SaaS products. [00:13:00] Or with installed versions of CMSs,<br />whether it&#8217;s WordPress or something else. Because, you know, in the WordPress world, we&#8217;re<br />used to looking at the the, the uh, dot org repository, and we have 65 to 70,000 plugins in there<br />now.<br />And what ends up happening is, Um, we&#8217;re thinking about that as our world, but in the<br />enterprise, um, I think that over the last 12 years, it&#8217;s gone from something like 1200 SaaS<br />products to over 10,000 SaaS products and. The enterprise is going, I want to try these<br />innovations. How do I try these innovations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;re stuck with like, how do I churn away from one SaaS to another? What do I do? Yes.<br />So there&#8217;s this opportunity at the moment, right now, if you think of the concept of a bicycle<br />wheel, we can use the WordPress project and open source as a hub to use spokes to [00:14:00]<br />connect out. To any number of sass,<br />but keep the experience in the roadmap of where you want to go within the WordPress project<br />and what you&#8217;re doing in WordPress.<br />And then if you wanna move from one CRM package to the next CRM package, as long as you.<br />Connecting in the right way and having the right data policies. You can detach and reattach, you<br />can do all sorts of things. It&#8217;s a little bit more complicated than I&#8217;m making it sound, but the<br />bottom line is that the enterprise clients have the opportunity to try things and maintain their<br />roadmap.<br />So this is a giant opportunity for the WordPress project to say, we&#8217;re gonna be a Swiss Army<br />knife, we&#8217;re gonna be a hub. So that way.<br />Enterprise customers can connect to one thing, try the next, try the next, and still maintain their<br />own vision of what their roadmap is. Does that make sense?<br />Cory Miller: Yeah, it does.<br />Um, [00:15:00] Alex, you came off mute. Do y&#8217;all two have have a comment on that?<br />Alex Nitu: Oh, I could talk for days, uh, on this, uh, that&#8217;s a loaded question. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I<br />like going a lot, uh, a lot of what you guys are saying. Uh, cuz really it&#8217;s about, um, breaking<br />that, that tip of the iceberg and democratizing all of these, uh, uh, these solutions that don&#8217;t<br />necessarily are, are necessarily easy to, to implement, be it by cost of ownerships, by, uh,<br />difficulty of implementation, by, uh, by, in a, by a case by case manner where.<br />Your infrastructure or your your needs need to be, uh, uh, solved in a, in a bespoke manner. Uh,<br />so that&#8217;s really about, uh, finding that middle ground where, uh, you don&#8217;t need all that resources<br />or you are able to own your data or own your infrastructure and, uh, and your digital, uh, digital<br />[00:16:00] presence.<br />Cory Miller: I, I love what you said too, Karim.<br />Um, and we&#8217;re gonna have a conversation in a couple weeks about. More, uh, broader topic in<br />WordPress and the enterprise, and I really appreciate your leadership in, in our community, uh,<br />for WordPress and the enterprise, making sure the concerns, the needs, the challenges are<br />heard. And then at Crown Favorite, I love what you&#8217;re doing and providing some solutions to<br />meet those needs you seen on, um, the enterprise.<br />Karim Marucchi: But if I may, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a specific opportunity for everybody out there<br />who&#8217;s looking at what products they could come up with to not only think about how do I make a<br />product that I&#8217;m gonna make for an end user, but you can make a customizable product. There&#8217;s<br />lots of examples out there these days, but you can make a customizable product where you<br />could be solving a deep problem rather than a wide problem.<br />Mm-hmm. And you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re not charging the comer level prices. There&#8217;s so much<br />[00:17:00] opportunity for, for connecting to other SAEs, to other, uh, solutions that are next to<br />WordPress and outside of WordPress that just haven&#8217;t even been tapped. The plugin community<br />in WordPress has traditionally stayed within.<br />How do I help the self-service? Um, the self-service web designer manager, uh,<br />Admin, right. Um, there&#8217;s so many more things that can be done.<br />It&#8217;s just a matter of seeing deep rather than wide. I think that&#8217;s where I start that conversation.<br />Yeah. I know Pat views on this too, so I&#8217;m gonna shut up.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah, no, I like that deep, that that&#8217;s a perspective shift for a lot of, uh, developers<br />as you know, Karim in the space.<br />Um, pat, I&#8217;m curious, you&#8217;re taking all this, um, yeah. What you&#8217;re seeing too.<br />Pat Ramsey: Well, I think, uh, Karim said it earlier. You know, we&#8217;re seeing people push the<br />boundaries with these things and the explosion in sass, [00:18:00] especially since 2020. And<br />everybody going home and staying outta the office and deciding to build everything online.<br />Uh, you just saw this, this exponential explosion in, uh, services that are out there, data<br />services, data, you know, services for moving data services for transforming data services for<br />connecting to this, uh, drop ship place service for calculating something. It, it&#8217;s not even, you<br />know, it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very minuscule.<br />You know, uh, unit tasker type things that are out there now that you just didn&#8217;t see before. Um,<br />and so there&#8217;s 20 million of them, uh, and everybody wants to connect to &#8217;em and do this and do</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that, and do, you know, do the other thing with it. Um, I think, you know, one of the, one of the<br />biggest challenges is, uh, you know, wading through all of those that are out there and finding<br />what that set is that your, your customer needs.<br />So that makes productization a little bit difficult. You can&#8217;t just. Oh, install this and it&#8217;s gonna<br />magically [00:19:00] connect. Um, you know, one of the, the phrases that I&#8217;ve, I sort of hate<br />these days is this no code. The idea of no code. Somebody wrote code for no code to work. Uh,<br />it&#8217;s just, you know, uh, uh, I, I said this to the guys earlier, you know, even the Rosetta Stone,<br />which translated, you know, three or four of the world&#8217;s foremost languages.<br />Somebody had to sit there and carve all those things in the rock. So you gotta write code to<br />make these things work. And that&#8217;s where a lot of the work that we do in this space comes into<br />play is you&#8217;ve got sass that are out there and you&#8217;ve got your c m s and Andre&#8217;s exactly right.<br />WordPress is uniquely positioned to be that central connecting piece through its API and<br />through its open architecture to connect to X, Y, and Z and bring it together, uh, for, for your<br />customers to be able to do the things they need to do.<br />And so, uh, it, it is a really rich space. It is a different space than what you see in 95% of the<br />product [00:20:00] conversations that have happened in, in, you know, since the days of, of, of,<br />you know, the first page Lee, uh, you know, over a decade. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, uh, been a challenge to hit<br />that explosion in the enterprise space for products as it as it has been for mass market, simply<br />because the requirements are far more complex.<br />Cory Miller: Hmm. It&#8217;s like Karim said, they want to try things. That&#8217;s really compelling to me.<br />They want to try the things they&#8217;re seen out there and, and then, but to have this massive, I can&#8217;t<br />even imagine the roadmap. You all, you, particularly Pat, I know, manage those teams and<br />services and how they could try it.<br />Something they see out there, want to try it, but it&#8217;s big, massive thing they&#8217;ve got going in their<br />roadmap that they&#8217;ve, they&#8217;re want to try out and figure that out. Um,<br />Pat Ramsey: And They&#8217;ll push the limits on &#8217;em too. You know, like said, they&#8217;ll push the limits.<br />You know, they&#8217;ll, they&#8217;ll find a way to break, uh, to break a server, you know, because of just,<br />you know, the sheer amounts [00:21:00] of, of data that they have to deal with.<br />They&#8217;ll find a way to push an API to time out simply because there&#8217;s just too much that has to<br />happen. You know, there, there will be a business case in there somewhere that prevents. 90%<br />of the answers that you read about in any tech site on how to fix the problem, you can&#8217;t because<br />of a business case that exists.<br />So you&#8217;ve got to sit there and figure out another way around it. And it, it might sound, you know,<br />bubblegum and rubber bands, but, uh, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the world that you, you know,<br />that, that you live in, in this space. You can&#8217;t just say, oh, well, you know, you just have to do<br />this. No, you can&#8217;t. There&#8217;s a security policy, there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a business requirement, there&#8217;s a,<br />you know, a, a absolute critical system that can never be turned off or, or, you know, shut down<br />or something like that.<br />So you have to, you have to sit there and stand on your head, you know, lay upside down,<br />whatever it is, to, to try to figure out how do we go from here to here? Cause it&#8217;s not the path<br />that<br />Cory Miller: everybody else is [00:22:00] taking. And it seems like that when they wanna try,<br />like Karim was saying something, some department within an organization goes, we wanna do<br />this.<br />We like this, we want to do this. They need a safe environment and a safe place to be able to do<br />those things. It doesn&#8217;t disrupt all those other things. Yeah.<br />Karim Marucchi: Um, one of the things that I. Alex can speak for himself, but I&#8217;m sure, um,<br />what I hear him say is that he loves the fact that he&#8217;s solving problems one at a time for clients.<br />He gets to go deep so that he&#8217;s constantly trying to figure out whether it&#8217;s our service clients or<br />how to productize what we&#8217;ve done for one client and install over 3, 4, 5, 6 other clients like<br />trying to solve that problem deeply for clients. Is is something that&#8217;s a different world than comer,<br />but it&#8217;s not harder, it&#8217;s just different.<br />You can&#8217;t charge the lower rates that you would [00:23:00] charge for a comer product, but you<br />can solve that problem on a large scale.<br />Cory Miller: Right. It&#8217;s, it seems like it&#8217;s product with service. I mean, dependent on some of<br />those service-based customizations you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Nitu: I feel as though, uh, it&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s absolutely right.<br />There&#8217;s two completely different, uh, roadmaps for a, a general comer product and an enterprise<br />focused, uh, product. And, uh, with our favorite, I think we are fortuitous enough to, um, be able<br />to have this data set where, uh, we can, uh, Uh, drive a roadmap that is lean and it is, uh, spec<br />particularly focused for, uh, the enterprise needs and use that to, to provide that, uh, that white<br />glove, uh, enterprise, uh, uh, service and, uh, and experience, um, with, uh, with the product to<br />match that, um, gives you that flexibility for innovation, for, um, for testing and for, uh, [00:24:00]<br />Um, of, uh, essentially volatility and, uh, and ease of expansion.<br />Cory Miller: It&#8217;s almost like they want to go to Everest and you&#8217;re helicoptering in to base camp.<br />That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the product. And then, Hey, this is how we want to climb Everest. And, uh, you all<br />are, are the people that help them get there. So Alex, that&#8217;s certain, yeah. So Alex, I, I&#8217;m curious,<br />now we&#8217;ve heard from Pat and Karim, now when we get down to the level of like, Karim&#8217;s<br />highlighted the general topic personalization, but as the product manager for Crowd favorite<br />building a product, tell us what that is and what are those problems you&#8217;re solving for?<br />Alex Nitu: Sure. So, um, it&#8217;s really, um, it&#8217;s an integral part of a dxp, a digital, uh, a digital<br />experience platform. Um, and if you break it down into its, uh, into its, uh, founding, uh,<br />[00:25:00] parts personalization is, uh, is quite a large piece of that pie. Um, and what<br />personalization really is, it&#8217;s really just dynamic content displayed, um, For a, for a, uh, custom<br />tailored, uh, user, right?<br />So that, uh, is your user segments. And all of that starts from, uh, from your dataset. And this,<br />uh, feeds back into the idea of, uh, data ownership and, um, being able to, as a company to, to<br />fully own your data. Um, so that, uh, encompasses a lot more than just having access to it or<br />being able to, to view it or, um, or export it.<br />Uh, so going from that, you. As if you know your user base and you know your user personas<br />and the the target audience that you&#8217;re, that you&#8217;re, uh, mainly interested in and focused on, uh,<br />it&#8217;s that much easier to, to provide, uh, a tailored than, uh, bespoke, uh, a bespoke experience<br />to, to each of those, uh, of those, uh, user types.<br />Uh, and then, uh, After that, it&#8217;s really, [00:26:00] uh, all about the, the content, the editorial<br />experience. Um, so with, uh, with our personalization product, um, we, we, uh, do our best to,<br />um, not add additional steps to your workflow or, um, Impact your, your day-to-day, uh, your<br />day-to-day, um, uh, job. Um, and it&#8217;s meant to expand on it.<br />To improve on it, and to, uh, to make it that much, um, that much more, uh, beautiful and, and<br />captivating, um, uh, that much more engaging really. Um, and then that&#8217;s, uh, that&#8217;s reflected in<br />the, um, the, the products interface as well as the, uh, general user experience for it. So,<br />whereas with, uh, different set services, and don&#8217;t get me wrong, I absolutely, uh, likes us, uh,<br />so solutions and, uh, I absolutely believe there are, uh, time and a place for them.<br />But with this type of enterprise focused, bespoke product, [00:27:00] you get to keep your<br />workflow. You don&#8217;t have to have that long onboarding experience where you need to<br />completely revamp your methodology. Uh, you get to maintain your, uh, your own, uh, your own<br />set of, uh, steps to accomplish and then, and then just, um, amplify them or augment them.<br />Uh, it&#8217;s still part of your, uh, your same workflow. So that&#8217;s what I believe we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve managed<br />to accomplish with, uh, with the XP toolkit.<br />Cory Miller: What are a couple of the things that you&#8217;re excited about with this particular<br />product that you&#8217;re working on or, or have done with it?<br />Alex Nitu: Sure, sure. So, uh, again, it feeds back into, into owning your data, right?<br />So if you think about it, where can you best, uh, identify these, uh, these user personas? Well,<br />that comes from your analytics engines, that comes from your CRMs, that comes from all these<br />types of, of, uh, customer experience or. Or, um, uh, management, uh, uh, platforms. So what<br />we [00:28:00] did was, um, again, focusing and using the dataset that we have access to, we&#8217;ve<br />identified all of these, uh, major, uh, integration components and, uh, and tackle them one by<br />one.<br />So we are now able to fully integrate with, uh, your analytic services with Salesforce, with all of<br />these types of CRMs and platforms that are data driven, driven. To then use all of that, all of<br />those data points to effectively personalize your content and display it for a particular use case<br />or user persona.<br />Thank you. What I feel is, is most exciting, having all of those user segments and all of that data<br />already existing and reporting and to your liking, and then just, uh, as simple as a, with a click of</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a button, being able to, um, Personalized content for that particular, uh, subgroup of, of visitors<br />or users.<br />Karim Marucchi: So Alex just went deep on something that I think needs to be called out<br />because it&#8217;s second nature. [00:29:00] Some of us sometimes are dealing with our clients, but<br />folks might not realize it on the comer side. Um, when I said earlier about solving a problem<br />deeply, Alex just gave a great example. Um, We work on a lot of personalization and, um, the<br />progressive profiling for clients and we actually use the plugin we have on the WordPress<br />repository, um, as a sort of a sandbox, a place to play around with certain aspects.<br />We package the things there that we can package and our sort of, you can install it and use it,<br />but you&#8217;ll notice that we&#8217;re trying to solve a problem even in that deeply, so we&#8217;re not building<br />our own little analytics piece within the personalization. We&#8217;re saying this is gonna do content<br />rules. If you wanna see what&#8217;s coming out of the content shifts you&#8217;re making on your website<br />when you&#8217;re customizing page A or page B.<br />[00:30:00] Or, you know, block A or block B, um, go check out your mamo installation because<br />we plug into that. Go check out your GA four because we plug into that. In the comer world<br />there&#8217;s a lot of, um, plugin and application bloat because developers tend to try and create more<br />and more and more features, again, wide rather than deep.<br />Do what you&#8217;re doing best, solve your problem well and in a performant fashion, and then<br />connect to a best of breed solution for analytics. So Alex said that very quickly, so the<br />developers on this conversation pick that up. But for, for the folks who are talking about creating<br />products, you know, think that way.<br />There&#8217;s a way to go deep. Yeah Pat .<br />Pat Ramsey: Well, there, there, there is. Exactly. But I think you, you&#8217;re illustrating perfectly that<br />difference between mass market audiences and the enterprise, uh, audiences. Uh, you know,<br />there&#8217;s absolutely nothing [00:31:00] wrong with something like, uh, like a jet pack stats that&#8217;s<br />out there for your, your mass market audience.<br />There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that at all. The WP Analytics, uh, some of the little analytics plugins<br />that have been out there, that have built that bring analytics into your site because, You know,<br />you, you need that, that&#8217;s that democratization of the ability so that anybody who can get that<br />code and install it can get it up and running and have a, have a website with those tools there.<br />We don&#8217;t see that in the enterprise space though, because in the enterprise space, they&#8217;re<br />gonna be, they&#8217;re gonna look at, they&#8217;re gonna look at that and go, no, we&#8217;ve got 12 years in an<br />Adobe analytics system that we&#8217;re not getting rid of. We&#8217;ve got a decade in Google Analytics.<br />You know, we&#8217;ve got our own install of p WIC before it became me tomo.<br />And we cannot get rid of that data. You can argue whether or not some of that needs to go or<br />stay. That&#8217;s different conversation. But the point is they&#8217;re not going to change. To a turnkey little<br />solution that that sort of one size fits all type of things that [00:32:00] works in the mass market<br />space. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the perfect example of that paradigm shift that we have to deal with.<br />So our approach has been, we&#8217;re not gonna tell you to use this c r m or that C R m or this<br />analytics tool, or that analytics tool or, or what have you. This mail&#8217;s platform versus this mail<br />platform. Does it have an a p I. Do the endpoints exist that are, are gonna get that data that we<br />need. Let&#8217;s build all that up and get that connected in here so that now you&#8217;re as a marketing<br />team, not so much the tech team, but over here to your marketing team, you can be creating<br />content and reading the results and the impact and the reach and the effectiveness of all of that.<br />And based on that, do do content, do different journeys, do different things. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s bridging<br />the data, the analytics and everything together in your cms.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah, I love that. Doing the one thing, um, because I can [00:33:00] also just kind<br />of, Predict or look, see that when you can&#8217;t bloat with some of these sites we&#8217;re talking about,<br />you can&#8217;t bloat, you don&#8217;t want to bloat.<br />It&#8217;s going to have performance issues as Karim mentioned. Um, before we get to the money<br />question, here&#8217;s the thing I want to ask because I&#8217;ve heard this a couple times. Um, this, I love<br />that you&#8217;re doing personalization cuz that really triggers my marketing side. I go, oh, I love<br />WordPress. One of the.<br />Awesome benefits of WordPress is you can put your things online, you can test ideas, you can<br />test new marketing things. And many of our, um, agency members who serve the enterprise talk</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a lot about what I hear is they love WordPress on the enterprise cuz of two things. It&#8217;s faster and<br />it&#8217;s probably cheaper.<br />And I don&#8217;t mean that to, to downgrade. It&#8217;s like they can deli, get the products they want faster<br />and more affordably than they can from proprietary. And the third thing, when. You said this,<br />[00:34:00] and I keep coming back to it. When you hear, when you say the word try, I think<br />marketing, I wanna be able to try this new concept, try this new idea, try this new strategy or<br />tactic.<br />Um, and so it seems like under personalization, you&#8217;re camping out with what I think is a<br />strength of WordPress overall, but especially in enterprises marketing. People love WordPress<br />on the enterprise because of these things. Mm-hmm. Right,<br />Karim Marucchi: right. Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly the case. We&#8217;re able, we&#8217;re able to create a feature<br />for a client that is sometimes a third of the cost of an enterprise product or SaaS platform out<br />there.<br />I won&#8217;t name any names to piss people off. Um, but then when you said cheap, it&#8217;s not about<br />cheap because if they&#8217;re saving 30, 40, 50, 60, 70%. Because they&#8217;re using WordPress. It&#8217;s not<br />that they&#8217;re being cheap. They&#8217;re actually putting that money back into trying [00:35:00]<br />something new. Just like you said, they can put that money back into marketing.<br />They can put that money back into, well, there&#8217;s a new email solution out there that does<br />something different. Let&#8217;s try that. There&#8217;s a new thing<br />that&#8217;s out there. How do we hook up to that?<br />So the cheap conversation goes away and it becomes of. How am I spending my money if I&#8217;m<br />saving money because I&#8217;m using an open source framework, because that&#8217;s how we describe<br />WordPress in the enterprise.<br />An open source framework. If I&#8217;m gonna save money by using an open source framework, how<br />can I make the money, give me a better return on investment in my marketing? It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a no<br />brain, no brainer sale.<br />Cory Miller: One more thing before we talk about money. Um, actually two things. One, another<br />phrase you said was, own your data.<br />And that seems to be extremely powerful, especially in the age, increasingly more and more,<br />um, privacy. Uh, issues coming on. You know, GDPR was a big, it was a big [00:36:00] wave<br />and I think it was a good wave, but it was a big wave for a lot of us to do online work. Um, but y<br />you know, Alex, could you speak to a second?<br />There&#8217;s two, two avatars. You&#8217;re kind of two people groups. You&#8217;re kind of hitting with this, and I<br />wanna give you a second to speak to that. It seems like there&#8217;s the developer on team at the<br />company. That you&#8217;ve like, Hey, we&#8217;re not gonna blow. Like Pat said, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re gonna get in,<br />do our job. We&#8217;re not gonna try to recreate Google Analytics for you.<br />Like, no, you just need this bridge. You need, we&#8217;re gonna do our job, do a fast, slim, secure,<br />um, not bloated. And then the other side is these is marketers sitting there going, please give<br />me these tools so I can do these things and try these things to, to grow our company. Would you<br />speak to a second from a product perspective to those two avatars, what you&#8217;re trying to do?<br />Alex Nitu: Absolutely. Yeah. So, uh, from my P o V, um, it&#8217;s really a completely different<br />[00:37:00] value proposition when you&#8217;re talking about, uh, enterprise. Um, and from, uh, what I<br />found, it&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s all about, um, The cost of onboarding and the cost of ownership, that<br />particular solution. Right. Um, and the advantage with these, um, open source composable, um,<br />um, uh, products is that you do, uh, have, um, a minimal footprint on what it means to, to, um,<br />Onboard, offboard, move around, experiment and um, um, confirm and, and do reiterate.<br />Right? Um, and then in the case of, of personalization with, uh, with these two main, again, user<br />personas, uh, speaking back in the personalization terms, um, we need to, uh, to identify what.<br />Really are the, the, the pain points or the the costs of, of, um, building or, uh, creating content<br />that is personalized with the exp toolkit.<br />Um, and from the one end is the actual usage [00:38:00] and uh, um, the creation of that<br />content. So that&#8217;s where the marketer comes in. Where you don&#8217;t need to have a technical<br />background to be, just be able to create content and, and effectively target that content to your<br />desired user base. Um, so, uh, this, uh, um, ties back into what I was saying about that, uh, that<br />intuitive and fluent user experience.<br />Where it doesn&#8217;t detract from your, uh, your current workflow or current methodology of, of<br />building up that content and publishing it. Um, and that&#8217;s, uh, where, um, our, uh, page builder</p>\n\n\n\n<p>integration come in, come in where, uh, we are natively integrating with, uh, Gutenberg Beaver<br />Builder and our mentor. So, uh, you get your pick of the letter for, uh, For how you want to<br />create your content.<br />And that&#8217;s just the, the out of the box solutions, obviously. That&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s, uh, the whole<br />architecture is built to, to allow for that, uh, uh, customizability and extensibility. Uh, and that<br />moves over [00:39:00] into the section, the second part of, of the cost of, of owning, uh,<br />composable solution like this. Um, and that&#8217;s managing it.<br />Uh, and that&#8217;s where developers come in. So you need to be able to provide a, uh, reach, um,<br />exhaustive this, uh, uh, documentation there and have all the, the checks in place and the, the,<br />the hooks in place to, to be able to accurately and, and efficiently extended or modified it to your<br />particular needs. And with DB toolkit that&#8217;s built into it, and it&#8217;s, uh, One of the, the main, uh, the<br />main concepts that, uh, that we&#8217;ve identified when, uh, in, uh, first architecture in this, uh, uh,<br />this product that it should, um, allow for, uh, for customizability for that, uh, white glove service<br />where, um, you are able to, um, extend it or modify to suit your, your actual needs.<br />Um, that comes into play with code standards as well, with the architecture itself, with, uh,<br />performance of. And, [00:40:00] uh, all the other, uh, bits and pieces that make for a, a great<br />software product.<br />Karim Marucchi: But you, Corey, you mentioned, um, data ownership and Pat can explain it<br />more than I can, but business-wise, we have seen more and more of our clients say, yes, we&#8217;re<br />now connecting to all these things.<br />We&#8217;re now using these APIs. We wanna own that data. We don&#8217;t want it to sit out on the SaaS<br />or we wanna make sure that we have real time replication and so forth and so on. So Pat, if you<br />want to describe that for a minute, this is like the cutting edge of where some of our most<br />interesting clients are, are trying to see where they can interact in a new way.<br />Pat Ramsey: It&#8217;s about first party data. I&#8217;m a business, I engage with my customers. Um, there&#8217;s<br />a lot of concerns around privacy and data [00:41:00] ownership, uh, when your data gets sold<br />and resold and reused. So one of the flip sides to the advantage of having all these SaaS<br />services out there is you&#8217;re potentially spreading customer data around to.<br />30, 40, 50, 60, you know, whoever, all these different people who then turn around and<br />repurpose it, repackage it, you know, what have you. Um, you know, you load a script on your<br />site to, uh, to bring in, uh, uh, uh, tags of some kind. And you sit there and watch the network<br />site, the network connection in your browser, and, you know, there&#8217;s all these remote<br />connections being made.<br />Because of the relationships that they have with these other services, which are then getting<br />into your content. And so you, you know, your user data is going everywhere. So this idea of first<br />party data is, is, is big. Um, it&#8217;s one of the things that, uh, is attractive about and own your data<br />stance. So me as a, uh, me as a business [00:42:00] owner, setting up my website and<br />engaging with my customers, the more I can keep the data just between us.<br />My customers and myself the better.<br />So that, that&#8217;s, I mean, that&#8217;s kind of a, a, a,<br />Cory Miller: yeah, in nutshell that&#8217;s get<br />Pat Ramsey: wrapped around that. It makes it way more, it makes this open source approach<br />of using WordPress as this hub, which has a privacy API that you can hook into, which, you<br />know, you can retain the data there within, within your system. And if you don&#8217;t have to send it<br />out to a third party service, you know, don&#8217;t.<br />Cory Miller: And see that&#8217;s the perspective I was missing and I appreciate that too, is like that&#8217;s<br />your, that&#8217;s priceless. That&#8217;s a customer being able to pull a customer in a paying customer,<br />keep a paying customer, that&#8217;s enormous. So that side of that, I wasn&#8217;t seeing that initially. I was<br />seeing the privacy side of like, okay, well with Judy, Judy per PR and the emphasis for good<br />reason on privacy and your data is out there, [00:43:00] Google and others have.<br />I&#8217;ve been talking about this for a while and I&#8217;ve kind of been watching with the smile going, I<br />wonder how they&#8217;re gonna figure this out. Because more and more people are gonna say, I want<br />control of the data. And so it makes sense to me from that side is from a business perspective<br />that you do own it because then you control it.<br />Okay, so here&#8217;s the burning question and uh, we&#8217;re we&#8217;ll wrap up. But, um, I&#8217;m really curious<br />from being a product guy doing products more on the comer level. How does a product like this<br />make money on the enterprise, and how do you support that? Um, so who wants to take it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim Marucchi: I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll take the first stab at it, I guess, but, uh, I, I know, I know there&#8217;s<br />opinions here.<br />Um, so the bottom line here is, um, you&#8217;re not selling a volume of licenses. You&#8217;re selling very<br />few licenses, so they&#8217;re expensive. And you&#8217;re not necessarily even selling it based on a<br />[00:44:00] license. You&#8217;re selling it based on the install process that might actually have coltancy<br />in it. It might have, um, support on the tail end of installing it.<br />And you&#8217;re also getting paid basically for that support. So you can say there&#8217;s an install cost and<br />then there&#8217;s a maintenance cost that is like the yearly license you have, um, with a comer<br />product. But literally add a few zeros.<br />And even if you&#8217;re selling relatively few licenses a year, different numbers for different products,<br />um, you adapt the pricing to make sure that you&#8217;re making money, uh, as long as you&#8217;re solving<br />a problem that an enterprise client needs deeply and well.<br />And you&#8217;ve followed some of the things that have been talked about today. Um, It&#8217;s just a matter<br />of doing that, but you have to know your market. There&#8217;s, what we didn&#8217;t touch on today is really<br />knowing what you&#8217;re solving and knowing that there&#8217;s a market there, but [00:45:00] financially,<br />honestly, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just about making sure that you understand what you&#8217;re, the value you&#8217;re<br />bringing to your customer and charging appropriately.<br />It&#8217;s not about one off licenses .<br />Cory Miller: Well, from a business perspective, I see too. It&#8217;s not just, you know, we could. Kind<br />of amortize development costs and support costs because it was okay if 10,000 people buy this,<br />it&#8217;s $80, whatever it might be, you know? But this with the scenario of like the Mount Everest,<br />like there&#8217;s the hel, there&#8217;s one part that&#8217;s a helicopter flying to base camp, and then there&#8217;s a<br />team, Alex Pat others on their teams helping you get to where you&#8217;re going, which means.<br />It&#8217;s not a one size fits all route to that. Uh, and then we haven&#8217;t even touched on the<br />maintenance side of it. Like it&#8217;s not just delivering that path, it&#8217;s maintaining that path when all<br />these things flying in that could potentially break or cause issues. Well, thanks you three for<br />talking about WordPress products on [00:46:00] the enterprise.<br />Um, I&#8217;m very compelled. I&#8217;m so glad companies like cloud. Crowd favor to doing this because,<br />um, as WordPress grows and more and more people go, we want WordPress solutions,<br />especially on the enterprise. That just helps the whole entire ecosystem. And as we&#8217;re serving<br />those clients, users, customers better, that bodes well for all of us.<br />And as you mentioned, like there&#8217;s so many of these SaaS solutions that have come into that<br />space. But there&#8217;s unique needs you&#8217;ve identified from running your data, first party data thing<br />that Karim was saying, um, that need for customization when they want to try something out. I<br />think that&#8217;s pretty compelling.<br />But anything left that you all wanted to share as we run this down?<br />Karim Marucchi: Well, I, I&#8217;ll get in trouble with, um, Alex if I don&#8217;t mention this upfront to the<br />wider WordPress community out there. Um, take a look at the DXP toolkit that we have up on<br />the repository. If you have ideas on [00:47:00] how to make connections to other products and<br />other things, we&#8217;d love to collaborate.<br />Um, let us know. Give us a call.<br />Cory Miller: Awesome. So go find DXP toolkit on the repo. And then also Alex, where, where do<br />they find more information about the product that you&#8217;re building?<br />Alex Nitu: Dxptoolkit.com. That&#8217;s the first place you, you can look at. Uh, we also have a lot of<br />content available on crawford.com as well.<br />Um, talking about HP Toolkit and all the cool things it&#8217;s able to do. Um, it&#8217;s, uh, all this<br />conversation has really reminded me of, uh, The first time I joined the crowd favorite. And, uh,<br />the research I did, like, let&#8217;s see, what&#8217;s, uh, what&#8217;s all the, the buzz about this, uh, this company<br />I&#8217;m applying for, uh, and the two things that, that really, uh, uh, that I&#8217;ve re-identified was their,<br />uh, uh, enterprise expertise and, um, that white glove, uh, very, uh, highly sought after, um, um,<br />client experience.<br />And [00:48:00] that&#8217;s absolutely, um, echoed into, into the, the products as well. Where, um, you<br />are able to, to help inform and drive, uh, the products roadmap. And the user experience doesn&#8217;t<br />just start and end at, uh, the plugin installation. It goes from the website all the way until the,<br />until the very end where, uh, you do get the option for, uh, or you do get the advantage of<br />having that, uh, that very, uh, specific and very, uh, personalized, uh, customer support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so yeah, thanks for taking the time and, uh, I really enjoyed the talking, uh, products with<br />you.<br />Cory Miller: You too. Just a side note, so Alex and I got to meet last week, I think I mentioned,<br />got a private demo and we&#8217;ll be deploying this on Post Status in a month or two and uh, I&#8217;m<br />really looking forward to that because I want to try these type of things even when we&#8217;re not at<br />the enterprise level, but I look forward to that.<br />Thanks, Alex. Pat and Karim as always, appreciate you all and what you do in WordPress<br />[00:49:00] on the enterprise. Thanks everybody else for tuning in today and we&#8217;ll talk to you next<br />time.<br />Alex Nitu: Thank you, Corey. Thank you. Bye. Have a great day.

Pricing currently ranges from $149.50/year to $249.50/year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WishList Member was a pioneer,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;It was the first membership plugin I ever used, and it really inspired me to get more involved with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It showed me that a plugin could be a powerful catalyst, capable of transforming WordPress into a highly sophisticated membership platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ever since then (and all the while growing my own membership plugin, MemberPress), I’ve had a soft spot for WishList Member – <em>and </em>its founders.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caseproof has been scooping up smaller WordPress membership plugins lately, <a href=\"https://memberpress.com/blog/membermouse-joins-caseproof/\">adding MemberMouse</a> to its products earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To be 100% clear, as with MemberMouse and MemberPress, our goal is <strong><em>not</em></strong> to discontinue WishList, or to combine it with another membership plugin,&#8221; Williams said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant change coming to WishList Member as part of the acquisition is that the CourseCure LMS features will be rolled into the plugin. Those who purchase WishList Member now will get access to CourseCure for free. Childers said once the plugins are combined the price will go up. The company plans to deliver the same level of support and is not planning to change prices for existing customers.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 May 2023 21:45:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"BuddyPress: Let’s better organize the BuddyPress plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=329390\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://buddypress.org/2023/05/lets-better-organize-the-buddypress-plugin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9280:\"<p>Hi, here‘s the second post of our series about the new direction we plan to take regarding plugin maintenance and evolutions. In our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/2023/04/buddypress-has-a-new-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\">first post</a> we shared with you our new purpose « Get together safely, <strong>in your own way</strong>, in WordPress », let’s see how the feedback you shared with us <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/support/topic/what-is-the-most-important-thing-buddypress-is-missing/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> &amp; <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-plugin-usage-declining-remaining-contributors-discuss-path-forward\" target=\"_blank\">there</a> helped shape the new way, I believe, we should use to reorganize and simplify BuddyPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-329390\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key feedback about the BuddyPress plugin’s organization</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>« Ultimately the easier it is to use BuddyPress the more vibrant the ecosystem around it becomes »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« I would replace BuddyPress’ systems while building new things and break backwards compatibility on purpose, <strong>start on a new plugin</strong> »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« I’ve always heard/read was that those features were better off served by plugins. Whereas <strong>users would be more likely to expect them inside the core plugin</strong> »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« I may only want to use certain aspects of BuddyPress and <strong>NOT the whole pack</strong> »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« It would be neat though to have a <strong>BP-lite</strong> »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« A “<strong>BuddyPress</strong><strong> lite</strong>” plugin if you’re talking about “restarting from another plugin” might be worth some discussion. »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« We are into the WordPress Official Plugins directory, we should really use this advantage and <strong>split BuddyPress into smaller parts</strong> »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« BuddyPress plugins directory ».</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe we need an important change about the way we package features <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4e6.png\" alt=\"📦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. I’m convinced the <strong>BuddyPress « lite » idea</strong> is the right direction to take. Although as a developer we might not see a difference from the modularity of BuddyPress’s current code base (optional components can be activated or not), I can understand some users’ point of view: « why am I downloading code I will never use? ».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 10.0, we now have the « <strong>BuddyPress Add-ons</strong> » tab <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2795.png\" alt=\"➕\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> inside the « <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/plugins-add-new-screen/\" target=\"_blank\">Add Plugins</a> » Administration screen. This tab is listing the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/buddypress/\" target=\"_blank\">plugins BuddyPress favorited</a> inside the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org plugins directory</a>. So far we are only favoriting the ones the BuddyPress development team is maintaining. We can use this space to progressively move optional components into it. Of course, we would then also improve &amp; <strong>ease</strong> as much as possible the install process putting together a step where we’re asking what BuddyPress Add-ons site owners wish to download, install and activate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Progressively turning optional components into BuddyPress Add-ons would benefit end-users and third party plugin authors. The latter would be able to build alternatives to our optional components to challenge the BuddyPress development team and give end-users more choices to get the features meeting their needs. Of course they would keep the ability to simply extend Core or optional features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit about packaging each optional component as an add-on is: we&#8217;d then be able to have <strong>usage statistics</strong> about them and <strong>prioritize our work according to their popularity</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tab (in other words the plugins favorited by the BuddyPress team) could welcome third party plugins to progressively build a « <strong>safe</strong> » BuddyPress plugins/add-ons directory. Bringing this safety to our end-users would be the result of <strong>third party plugin authors engagement</strong> to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>define their dependency to BuddyPress in their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-attachments/blob/trunk/class-bp-attachments.php#L24\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">plugin’s main file header</a> to get ready for a potential « <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-plugin-dependencies/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Plugin dependencies</a> » merge into WordPress core.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>maintain their plugins in the long term, and eventually invite new maintainers to take over their work when they feel they cannot do it anymore.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bring <strong>free</strong> support to their users,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>embrace the WordPress etiquette, code formatting, i18n &amp; security best practices,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>test <strong>every</strong> new BuddyPress beta versions and report issues when needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stay updated</strong> by reading important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/category/development-notes/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developer notes</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure their plugin is <strong>fully compatible with latest BuddyPress</strong> version.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/participate-and-contribute/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Get involved</strong></a> at least twice a year into contributing to one or more of these areas: BuddyPress support, documentation, translation, events or code.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m convinced that end-users care more about <strong>features being actively maintained</strong> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"⚡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />than all of the features being included in one large plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The first concrete step</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A first version of the long awaited <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-attachments/\" target=\"_blank\">Media component</a> was released as a BuddyPress Add-on <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f5bc.png\" alt=\"🖼\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> on March 25 <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f382.png\" alt=\"🎂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. There’s still a lot of work to do but I believe it has a solid foundation: it uses ReactJS, blocks, the BP REST API and something I would name a « BuddyPress » way of storing media data.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-6\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-attachments/\">BP Attachments</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>One month after its release usage statistics is very low (fewer than 10 active installs). As it so far hasn’t gained much traction in an area that is served by existing third-party plugins, it’s suggesting to us that end-users do not consider the “Made/Maintained by BuddyPress” to be a sufficient advantage in and of itself. That’s a good thing: it’s challenging us to improve the plugin and to better communicate about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, BP Attachments is an interesting playground for us to use to find the best way for plugin developers to carry on being backward compatible with BuddyPress versions below and upper 12.0.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude with this feedback category, yes <strong>we need to reboot</strong>. But let’s do it gently to onboard &amp; keep on board as much as possible the members of our community:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>shrinking one step at a time BuddyPress to its Core features,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>moving optional components or new ones into external Add-ons,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>and putting backward compatibility inside another plugin (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-classic\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BP</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-classic\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Classic</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It should leave end-users the time to get used to a simplified &amp; reorganized BuddyPress and to plugin developers to upgrade their works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next post of this series will talk about some other BuddyPress « features » we are thinking of considering the feedback you gave us.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Props</strong>: many thanks to <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/dcavins/\">@dcavins</a> for his review <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60d.png\" alt=\"😍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 May 2023 18:58:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mathieu Viet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: WordPress Themes Team Releases Stacks: A Community Theme for Building Slide Decks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=144665\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-releases-stacks-a-community-theme-for-building-slide-decks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2471:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; Themes Team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/05/04/stacks-the-first-community-theme/\">released</a> a new block theme called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/stacks/\">Stacks</a> as part of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-proposes-community-themes-initiative\">Community Themes initiative</a> proposed earlier this year. The goal is to bring together representatives of the team to build block themes year round, the same way that default themes are built and officially supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stacks was designed for one purpose &#8211; to create slide decks that can be used for a presentation. It was designed and built by Saxon Fletcher with help from Automattic-sponsored contributor Ben Dwyer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme includes a simple setup flow. After installing Stacks and clicking &#8216;Customize,&#8217; the user is taken to the Site Editor where a set of five slides is already pre-filled on the home page in a warm and inviting color palette.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Slides can also be created on any post or page using the &#8220;Stacks&#8221; pattern. After creating a new page, the user is presented with the option to start the page by inserting the Stacks pattern. This loads the same five sample slides that are included on the home page by default. They can be easily edited so that any page or post contains its own unique slide deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Stacks theme looks just as good on mobile as it does on desktop, making it easy to follow along from different devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme was built for a small niche use case &#8211; people who want to host their own slides &#8211; and is not likely to be widely adopted but presents an interesting use of the block editor for creating slides. Some users may find this to be more user friendly than working with a third-party application to build their presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since a different deck can be hosted on each page or post, someone who wants to create a website devoted entirely to hosting their own slide presentations could easily save them all in the same place, share links to the different decks, and avoid having to use a hosted service that may not be around forever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stacks is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/stacks/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> and users can expect these Community Themes to have some level of support as they are being hosted by the official WordPress.org account.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 May 2023 17:09:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress.org blog: 2022 Annual Survey Results &amp; Next Steps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14923\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/2022-annual-survey-results-next-steps/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4918:\"<p>Each year, members of the WordPress community (users, site builders, extenders, and contributors) provide valuable feedback through an annual survey. For 2022, the survey received a comprehensive update, the first in six years. The total number of questions was reduced to 29 from nearly 100, socio-economic questions were mostly removed, and the Likert scale was introduced. These updates were intended to increase the completion rate of the survey, enable a more efficient and structured analysis of these data, and position the survey to best gauge the topics that matter most to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal is that the input received via the survey helps inform initiatives and focus areas for WordPress in the near term, along with other signals, such as conversations in the community, the Making WordPress blogs, and events. Such data play a key role in shaping the direction and strategy of the project and measuring progress in focus areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2022 Highlights</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2022 edition of the survey experienced a 26% increase in completion rate, however, submissions decreased by 56% to roughly 3400, including about 800 contributors. For the 2023 survey, promotion will be increased, hopefully counteracting the declining submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some key takeaways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The survey shows an increased usage of blocks and the new site editor (versus the classic editor), which shouldn’t come as a surprise since the default theme is now a block theme.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>22% of respondents have only used WordPress for a year or less. Those responding to the survey are also getting a bit older, with fewer responses from those under 40 than in prior years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 in 5 respondents learned about WordPress from a coworker, and about the same percentage from using a search engine.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In 2022, WordPressers continued to learn about WordPress (68%), taught others about WP (48%), and built sites for others (55%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPressers choose the CMS platform because it’s open source (62%), flexible (47%), low risk (45%), cost-effective (45%), and has a positive reputation (41%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>57% of survey participants obtained news and training directly from <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">WordPress.org</a>. While that is the primary source, other sites remain very important: search engines (46%), YouTube (40%), other WordPress communities (35%), and social media (30%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The overwhelming majority of respondents don’t regularly use other CMS platforms, and 21% of respondents use none of the top 20 WordPress plugins.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents continue to state that “WordPress is as good as or better than other CMS platforms,” with 68% agreeing. Elements that respondents feel are the best aspects of WordPress include “ease of use,” “flexibility,” and/or “plugin options,” all about 30% each. When asked about the most frustrating elements of WordPress, 1 in 5 said, “nothing,” while approximately 30% referenced difficulties with site editing / Gutenberg.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The overall contributor experience remains positive and something I continue to care about deeply. 64% shared they had a positive experience, and 24% viewed their experience as “neutral.” Contributors also feel welcome at the same percentages (64% agree and 24% are neutral).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Planned for 2023</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the language options for completing the survey and continue investing in refining the questions and how they are asked. It is important to be mindful that completing a survey takes time, so we want to make sure community members are being asked questions that help WordPress the most.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tentative plan is to launch the 2023 edition in August. This will set up an opportunity for the 2023 results and, most importantly, your input to inform planning for 2024’s key initiatives and focus areas.

Additionally, there is a proposal needing your feedback around improving image performance. Felix Arntz notes that adding <code>fetchpriority=”high”</code> to the LCP image typically improves LCP performance by 5-10%. <br /><br />The latest call for testing from the Test team includes an exercise using the new Grid view, as well as creating pages from patters.  </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-infobox

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case finding a place in the WordPress community as a non coder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Ahmed Kabir Chaion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you&#8217;ll hear in the podcast, Ahmed has a genuine love of the WordPress community. He&#8217;s been an organizer at multiple WordPress events, including WordCamp Asia, the WordPress Accessibility Day. WordFest Live, WordCamp Santa Clarita, and the WordPress Translation Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As if that were not enough, he&#8217;s also served as the co-organizer of the Dhaka WordPress meetup chapter, is a former Design Team rep, and a current Polyglots Team rep. Like I said, Ahmed is really engaged in the WordPress community, but how did all this happen? The podcast today focuses on Ahmed&#8217;s journey into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given Ahmed&#8217;s involvement in the recent WordCamp Asia, we start the discussion there, talking about how the event went and what plans there are for next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then get into what the WordPress community is like in the city of Dhaka and Bangladesh as a whole. Technology has become a popular career option, and WordPress is playing a crucial role in that. We talk about how the community is growing, particularly through local meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the podcast is all about how you can find a place in the WordPress community no matter what your strengths are. Maybe you&#8217;re into writing code or SEO. Perhaps marketing or translations or more your thing. Ahmed lays out the multitude of paths that you can take to engage and give back to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to feel you&#8217;ve got to be an expert. The project needs people working at every level, and maybe there&#8217;s work to be done which you did not know about. That&#8217;s certainly Ahmed&#8217;s experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He tells us how we got started just by showing up repeatedly, slowly working out areas where he thought his contributions would be most valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about some of the places Ahmed has frequented online, and some people he&#8217;s been most influenced by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a lovely tale of a community member who is truly inspired to make the project better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In places, the quality of Ahmed&#8217;s audio is a little poor. But it&#8217;s more than listable, especially given how enthusiastic Ahmed is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ahmed Kabir Chaion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Ahmed Kabir Chaion. Hello, Ahmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Hi Nathan. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] Nathan Wrigley: I am so pleased that we&#8217;ve got you on the podcast today. We don&#8217;t usually reveal about the technical gremlins, but we did have some technical gremlins, so much so that a previous podcast recording we abandoned, and we&#8217;ve come back today to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, Ahmed, really fully appreciate you sticking with the process and helping me get this podcast episode out. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Thank you, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re very welcome. So you&#8217;re on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to talk about open source contributions and who might do that, and how you might do that. And indeed, what you might do, whether you are a coder or a non coder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ahmed, just before we begin, we always typically ask the podcast guests to spend a moment just telling the audience about who they are, where they&#8217;re from, what they&#8217;ve been involved within the WordPress space. So may I ask you that question? Just tell us a little bit about yourself and how you relate to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Absolutely. So my name is Ahmed and I&#8217;m from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I started my WordPress journey in 2009 for a university project. And then I shifted into my major, which was network security. I graduated from Central Queensland University in Australia. From 2010 to 2019, nine years, I was not involved with WordPress by any means, not even professionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I came back to Bangladesh in 2016, and in 2019 when I switched my workplace, I joined a company called weDevs, from where I actually got involved into WordPress on a full-time basis. And I found that there are some voluntary options, opportunities, and scopes where people can go in and improve WordPress as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, not being a programmer or someone who likes to code myself, I was looking for ways to contribute to the project. And then, during the covid lockdown March in 2020, I started going through the handbook and other articles, blogs, tutorials that you can find in the internet possibly, to getting involved in the wordpress.org side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And slowly I started to see that it&#8217;s not always about writing codes and, going through the major release. And I started learning more about the Make WordPress Team. And then I found that there are many teams where I can get involved and I can start slowly be a regular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started with the marketing team, then went to documentation, and so on. Late 2020, one of the team reps for the design team suggested that I could also be a team rep. And being team rep did not have to be something that requires me subject knowledge or extraordinary skills, it can be something that I&#8217;m committed to giving back. And that&#8217;s where I basically fell in love with giving back to the community. Voluntary work for open source and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And gradually attended online WorkCamps. Became a co-organizer of my local WorkCamp, and Meetup as well. And then I organize online WordCamps. Just a month back, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Asia and so on. I feel like my journey has only started Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:32] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s great. We share show notes, so Ahmed has shared me a variety of different things that he&#8217;s been involved with, and really over the last couple of years, during the pandemic and obviously subsequently with things like WordCamp Asia, there&#8217;s a whole laundry list of things that you&#8217;ve been involved in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we mentioned WordCamp Asia, Accessibility Day. You&#8217;ve been involved in WordFest Live, and a whole bunch of other things. There&#8217;s a great big laundry list. So, firstly, thank you. The project doesn&#8217;t move forward without people such as yourself. So we&#8217;re in your debt for taking so much on in the recent past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Thank you so much. I guess recognition is something that motivates people, but personally I am happy to continue as much as long as I can, because I considered this as a privilege. That I&#8217;m able to give back to the project and also collaborate with many folks across the world. So I think it&#8217;s a privilege for me be able to give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s so nice. I want to digress just a little bit because of a couple of things that you said there. Firstly, I want to ask you about your experience at WordCamp Asia. It finished a little while ago. I&#8217;m not entirely sure when this podcast episode will go out, so there may be several weeks between it finishing and the podcast airing, but regardless of that. You attended, and by all accounts you enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your experience there. You can talk about the organizational side, if you like, or just purely what you did, or how you enjoyed it. What you thought about it. What were your memories from that event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:06] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Right. WordCamp Asia is the first flagship event within Asia, and the biggest WordPress event in Asia as well. As we all know, it was scheduled to happen in 2020, right before we had lockdown instructions and not have WordCamp Asia three years ago. With the hard work and effort for everyone, WordCamp Asia finally took place in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an organizational point of view, I went through the application for becoming an organizer, and I was allocated to the contributor day team, which perfectly fit with my interest, passion. And, as part of the contributor day team, I was able to inspire many contributors through 11 live episodes that we did. We did some webinars on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube live, and we were able to engage with contributors across Asia who would eventually, I believe about 50% or more actually showed up for the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though we weren&#8217;t selling tickets for the WordCamp, we were getting lots of inquiries related to that because people wanted to come, and attend the biggest contributor day event in Asia. And successfully the first day of the WordCamp, which was 17th of February, we had 650 registered participants who were supposed to come up, and ended up having 700 plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People were so keen to contribute. We had snacks and lunch allocated for registered participants. Some folks came to the door and said, hey, I just want to contribute. If you have a seat, let me take part. I don&#8217;t mind having snacks or lunch. I&#8217;m happy to just be here because it&#8217;s first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my contribution to the WordCamp Asia, I feel like myself, along with our team lead, Sandilya Kafle, who&#8217;s from Nepal, and he has been the themes team rep for quite some time. We also had two other members, Uygyen Dorji, who&#8217;s from Bhutan, and Lax, who&#8217;s from Philippines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So four of us actually managed the whole contributor day side of things. Outreaching to teams. Making sure we have representation, contributor table leads, and they have a plan. We contributed for about seven to eight hours on 17th of February. We received great feedback, good feedback from the participants, from the table lead, sponsors, anyone who came in said that they had a great time contributing and collaborating together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even folks who were not from Asia gave feedback saying that it&#8217;s culturally vibrant, and it&#8217;s also fulfilling to collaborate together. So from that point of view, I feel like we had an excellent time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward to the next two days, 18 and 19, which is WordCamp Asia. We kicked off with Matts Asking Me Anything, more like fireside chat with Josepha being there as one of the co-hosts. That pretty much set the tone for the WordCamp, and we had excellent round of speakers, which people can go in and check from WordCamp Asia YouTube channel. All the sessions are still being uploaded, and information is there on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel that it was a much needed event and now that we have WordCamp Asia on the calendar itself, WordCamp Asia 2024, which will take place in Taipai, Taiwan is going to be a much bigger one. And even better one, because from an organizational point of view we will learn more than we actually accomplished in the past 10 months, 12 months, I should say. Started somewhere around this time last month of organizing. It&#8217;s been an experience that we want to relive again and again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:58] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, nice. I had quite a few chats with people who were in attendance that I know and the general feeling that I got from them, I didn&#8217;t attend, so I should probably throw that in. The general feeling that I got from more or less everybody that I spoke to was that it was quite a special event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They weren&#8217;t really able to capture why they thought it was special, but there was something going on at that event that they thought was pretty extraordinary. Maybe it was the fact that it was the first time. Maybe it was the fact that they were attending a country that they had perhaps not been to before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was something there. I don&#8217;t know. But everybody that I spoke to really had something incredibly positive to say about it. So yeah, big congratulations to the entire team of people who pulled that off. Very much appreciated and looking forward to Taiwan next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to just change direction just very quickly again before we get into the main subject, because in your introduction you mentioned that you are in Bangladesh. You mentioned Dhaka, I don&#8217;t know if you actually live there not. But I wonder if, for the audience listening, I wonder if you could paint a picture of what the word WordPress community is like in Dhaka or perhaps better yet, in Bangladesh in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be nice to kind of prize that open so that we can have some feeling for whether the software is being used and developed and talked about, and are there events that are happening over there? Really just a broad question. What&#8217;s the WordPress community look like in Bangladesh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:28] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting question. I&#8217;m going to try to paint my version of the picture about this, because there are three aspects. Aspect one is that WordPress and contributing to WordPress and open source is not fairly new to Bangladesh. It&#8217;s been there, but then again, everyone wants to be either recognized or have something as a return because of their recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess it comes from the fact that we are developing, and people want to spend most of their time in getting something back or being productive. So, contributing to open source is something that people does not take that positively because they want to spend that time for work or other purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there are communities and leaders within the community who encourage others, and it&#8217;s slowly, gradually building. I feel from 2020 onwards, since the lockdown happened, many people have looked back and utilizing their leisure hours, where they just want to do something more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want to improve their skills. And from the point of learning new things, WordPress comes up simply because we have a growing community of freelancers, and the freelancer community has been there since 2010, 2011. And a major portion of our revenue, foreign currency revenue, comes from freelancers. Which is why software companies in Bangladesh do get many benefits if they&#8217;re bringing foreign reserves to Bangladesh, for example, dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So freelancers numbers growing. So they know WordPress for a profession. They use WordPress for their clients, for their different projects. Marketplaces have 80 to 90% projects related to WordPress. And this number fluctuates from now and then. But when it comes to contributing to WordPress Core, people aren&#8217;t aware because of another thing called communication skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is something we are lacking for many years now. And I work with a lot of freelancers trying to train them with their level of English. I even work with companies improving their corporate communication business and formal writing, all of those stuff, since I was trainer back in Australia. And that experience came in handy when I started collaborating with the freelancer community in Bangladesh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have one organization called B D O S N, Bangladesh Open Source Network, and that was the primary driver of open source events and open source platforms. They had lots of events about Mozilla and WordPress. But as we got closer to the pandemic, it slowly decreased and pretty much non-existent this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second aspect of your question is that people know about WordPress because we have seven Meetup chapters within the country, and Dhaka being the capital is one of the most active one, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong for me to say that it&#8217;s pretty much leading the efforts of community engagement for WordPress. Encouraging people to attend Meetup events. Letting people know that they can Host Meetup events, and in general sharing information about that, the knowledge share about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Dhaka&#8217;s been inspiring Chittagong, then Barisal, Sylhet. These are different Meetup chapters within Bangladesh. And a result of that is actually WordCamp Sylhet scheduled for May 19th this year. So, in 2019, we had our first and only WordCamp in Bangladesh, which was called WordCamp Dhaka 2019. Now we&#8217;re going to have WordCamp Sylhet on May 19th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel that it&#8217;s still a work in progress. So a lot of people still come to Meetups and say that this is their first time joining a Meetup. And we had about 275 people attending WordCamp Asia from Bangladesh only. So that brings in the third aspect of your question that we&#8217;re getting regular folks coming to the Meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was fortunate to be able to host the first mega Meetup of the country, last year in November. I hosted a meetup with one of my colleagues, named Yeasin Rahman. I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s listening or will be listening. Shout out to him, because both of us organized an event with 170 people joining. We had five speaker sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was around five hour event. We got sponsors luckily, and it was like a mini WordCamp. We got the feedback people coming back to saying, hey, you hosted a mini WordCamp. It was not a WordCamp, it was just a WordPress Meetup, and I was inspired by the South Florida Mega Meetup, posted by David Bisset. I got the idea that you could bundle and merge Meetup chapters and have a bigger event to give more people allocation for the event. Usually in our meetups, we get 50, average 50 participants, so having 170 plus was the next step for us to getting there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to summarise, the answer to your question. The government acknowledges open source and WordPress is there. We have some initiatives, but that&#8217;s only for the companies and organizations, software developing companies and whatnot. B D O S N, as I mentioned, is still not that active. I feel there&#8217;s not enough contributors there. And when it comes to WordPress, I do see this particular release, 6.2, which is scheduled within a week and a half. So around 30th of March, we will have what per 6.2 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I at least feel or expect and anticipate that we&#8217;ll have 50 plus contributors from Bangladesh itself. So that is a big number as well for us, because last time we had about 30 or even less. So, it&#8217;s going to a direction when we will have regular contributors contributing to WordPress, attending WordCamps, hosting events, and just carry it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:55] Nathan Wrigley: It really does sound like there&#8217;s an awful lot going on in your part of the world and a great deal of excitement and change and new people coming in and new events and a whole ground swell of new and interesting challenges arising. That really genuinely was fascinating. I really enjoyed that. Thank you for describing that in such detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:16] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: My pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:17] Nathan Wrigley: It would be, really interesting if anybody was listening to this who is from your part of the world who hasn&#8217;t reached out, maybe this podcast episode will get even more people, you never know, attending. That would be lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll move on to the main thrust of our conversation today because the topic which we had designed for this podcast episode was all about non code contribution to WordPress. And I know that that&#8217;s an area that you are very keen on. You mentioned in your introduction that you don&#8217;t really classify yourself as a coder. But clearly from everything that you&#8217;ve said, you definitely classify yourself as a WordPresser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s how this conversation&#8217;s going to develop. I wonder if you could talk to us about your experience as to whether when you began dipping your feet into the WordPress ecosystem, did you sense that it was okay to be a non coder, or as I&#8217;ve heard many stories of people who, when they begin and they attend events, or they just start looking into community online, there&#8217;s this feeling that if you&#8217;re not into code, it might be more difficult to find your place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I think as time has gone on, certainly in the last several years, I feel that&#8217;s less true in that we&#8217;ve figured out now that there are literally hundreds of different roles for people who don&#8217;t code. But I wondered what your experience was when you first encountered WordPress. Did you have that feeling of, if I&#8217;m not coding, I&#8217;m not sure I belong here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:45] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Yeah, I did. The general consensus is that when you first join the make, making WordPress Slack, you land on the Core channel, and you see 30,000, I think it&#8217;s 40,000 now, 40,000 members in the Core channel. And the ones who are active around couple hundred people are talking about different code, sharing tickets of issues. It doesn&#8217;t feel like that anyone who doesn&#8217;t understand this can be a part of this. It gets intimidating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for myself, when I first started, as I was going through Slack and exploring new channels, I found out there are teams called Marketing, Documentation, and, Polyglots and so on. So I started with marketing and I realized that you did not need to know coding or you did not have to write a developer field guide, or even you need to write a test report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that got me thinking that, hey, that means it&#8217;s not always about writing code. It&#8217;s not always about customizing the front end of WordPress and so on. So I felt that, which usually we all feel when we first start. But lucky for me, I&#8217;m going to take some names because people have been nice to me and I was fortunate to have some guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was Yvette Sonneveld, who&#8217;s currently working at Yoast, who used to be the then marketing team rep, who helped me a great deal around that time. There was Michelle Frechette, who I&#8217;m sure is a good friend of yours, and she&#8217;s been kind enough to spend many hours on Zoom. Not for my sake, but you know, different coffee breaks that used to be hosted in during the lockdown, marketing team used to have a monthly coffee break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they still do it. And I used to join those Zoom calls, which would be very difficult for my time zone, around 2 or 3:00 AM, midnight my time. But I would still stay up because I had literally nothing else to do, and people were in lockdown. So I would just attend there first three, four, or six weeks. I would just listen to what everyone else was saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as time progressed, and they were kind enough to just let us stay on the call and not speak a single word. So I give my thanks back to people. There are many names, I just cannot think of the names right now. But Milana, from documentation team, there&#8217;s John from documentation team. Abha Thakor from the marketing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like these are the folks who primarily set the tone for me and encourage that, yes. I&#8217;m not a programmer, and regardless of where I&#8217;m from, I can just give my time back in many different ways. And I started writing meeting notes, summary of a Slack meeting. I started posting those summaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started creating new agenda items, you know, talking to back and forth, different contributors. Even different time zones, some teams have meeting in different time zones. You know, there&#8217;s the EMEA, there&#8217;s this APAC one. So, going back and forth and trying to make sure the information is sustained across team communication is where I learned the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as part of the marketing team, I would attend other team meetings just to collect information from there, which we can then repurpose or re-share with other teams. These are ways that I got involved. And then jump to the documentation team. Like I said, Estella Webber. We have many other, I just can&#8217;t think of the names and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being fair to them. These names need to be shouted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I saw this opportunity. Well, there was this post before a major release, there&#8217;s a call for release squad members. You could just raise your hand and say, hey, I want to be part of this release squad. And after I became a core contributor for the first time for 5.6, I thought, okay, I&#8217;ve become a core contributor without writing a code. I can maybe do something even bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I just share this with the audience that what I did was I tested an issue that was reported many years ago. I replicated the issue in different operating systems and then I took some screen recording. I wrote some feedback. That was it. I became a core contributor and that got me thinking that I could do even something bigger. So I raised my hand to become a release squad member. And these are names that I cannot forget. Jeffrey B. Paul, who works for 10up. There&#8217;s JB Audras, and there&#8217;s Peter Wilson, who&#8217;s from Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are three folks primarily who inspired me to start working, or even contribute to the trials team for core releases, major releases. And I got mentorship from these three folks who just said that you don&#8217;t need to be a programmer. You can listen to the discussion of the programmers on Slack. Summarize it, and the programmers can continue their discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I used to do, I used to sit in front of my computer for one hour on a dedicated time schedule. The developers from different parts of the world would show up, or a ticket would be raised, and everyone would look into the ticket and share their feedback and ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes one ticket can spend an hour. Sometimes each ticket can be two minutes, three minutes long discussion. My job, my role was to summarize everything, document it, and making sure it&#8217;s passed onto the next meeting. Or, more importantly, update each ticket with what to do next, some recommendation. Sometimes I would do testing as well. And that&#8217;s how I found my place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I&#8217;m good at doing that. I&#8217;m confident at finding years old tickets, making sure we triage them. These are stuff that took me to the next level and I&#8217;m ready to give my time back again for WordPress 6.3 release squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:59] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s amazing. Such an interesting story and unlike one I&#8217;ve heard before actually. So a core contributor, but no code in sight. But nevertheless a very important set of roles that you were describing there. I wonder, you&#8217;ve obviously thrown yourself into this. In other words it does sound like it&#8217;s become an incredibly important part of what you do, and I wonder if you have any thoughts for people who really really maybe don&#8217;t have the time available that you do? Are not quite sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t see that they&#8217;ll probably ever be as keen as you seem to be. Do you think there&#8217;s a place for them? Is it more a case that if you are willing to really go the extra mile then these wonderful things can happen? Or is it the case that people who can just contribute perhaps a few minutes a week are still welcome and needed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:50] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: In short both. But for this to be meaningful and for someone to be satisfied about what they do, you need to go the long, longer path. If you are keen to learn something new. If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more and tap into the unknown, then WordPress is a beautiful prospect. I feel every team that I tap into, I learn something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m collaborating with the training team and they have this project called Learn WordPress, which is going to be an amazing thing in a couple of years. It&#8217;s already there with many different languages of workshops, tutorials, and information about WordPress. Not just WordPress as a platform, but more like different aspects of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, even as a programmer, there are different sides of programming. I&#8217;m not an expert, but I&#8217;ve noticed that some people like to do certain things. So there are components within WordPress. So if a programmer is interested about a particular component, they can start working on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I believe there&#8217;s 30 plus component with each of them having one to five, sometimes ten, component maintainers who take care of those components, which make sure that WordPress is equipped with everything new and not falling back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:09] Nathan Wrigley: It is truly remarkable, the depth and breadth of WordPress. So it&#8217;s kind of interesting. You&#8217;ve talked about the fact that you&#8217;ve dipped your toes into all sorts of different channels in WordPress. You&#8217;ve talked about marketing. You&#8217;ve talked about documentation and so on. I wonder, for people who are listening to this who are new to WordPress, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve got a list available or in your head, I wonder if you can summon up the range of different topics or areas within WordPress that people could become involved in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:39] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Sure. so there&#8217;s two set of common topics or checklists that I usually share. We had our latest Meetup just couple of days ago, and I was discussing this topic with a few of our new contributors. So one fact is that if someone&#8217;s willing to join the local Meetups, they should start there. That should always be the first step. That gives so much motivation and encouragement, and you can engage with a lot of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those who are able to attend those Meetups, they can start finding WordCamps nearby. I don&#8217;t know if everyone loves travel, but I love travel and it can sometimes do a positive change for you. So traveling blended with WordPress is a beautiful thing. Unless you experience it, you won&#8217;t be able to know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing is for those who does not want to go to the Meetup. For them, they can always go through the make.wordpress.org site. There are different teams. Just skim through and search for the team that feeds them most, or appropriate team. Find it and then go through that team&#8217;s handbook. Most of the teams these days have at least a workshop or tutorial within Learn WordPress. So if you want to contribute to WordPress org, you can check Learn WordPress first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly create a WordPress profile and then join the WordPress Slack. As soon as you are able to join a channel, start finding if there is a time which is convenient for you in terms of that team&#8217;s meeting. Because team meetings are essential for you to be directly involved with the project. Some teams have weekly meetings, some teams have biweekly, others have monthly meetings. So it&#8217;s not that difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to attend the entire meeting. Just stay up to date about your team of interest. About the agenda. What is the focus right now? What kind of work, different work groups are there. Try to tap into a work group. As soon as you are part of a work group, you will know about the details and the current stuff that&#8217;s in the pipeline for WordPress. And that can motivate a lot of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those who are programmers, they can easily just go to the Core team. And there&#8217;s many different sub-channel and sub-teams of Core. There&#8217;s Core test. There&#8217;s Core performance. There&#8217;s WPCLI and many more. I&#8217;m just sharing some of the names from the top of my head, because that&#8217;s not my strong suit, but there are about six or seven different key teams or sub-teams within the Core team where you can get involved in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve always noticed among contributors, if there&#8217;s anything that is within the sweet spot of their passion and interest, it gives them a better result. So, finding that is critical for someone, when it comes to going the long run and sustainably contributing for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:44] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned in the show notes that you had some resources to share. Now, it may be that you&#8217;ve just done that, and that was the list of things that you wanted to talk about. But I do want to give you an opportunity to share that list if indeed there were other things on it that you hadn&#8217;t yet mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:00] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Yep. I just want to add a name, Sam Munoz. I think she works for WP Engine, and is the community developer relationship manager. Apologies if I got her designation wrong. But I have seen her in the documentation team and coming in and always contributing. And she&#8217;s the one who inspired me to talk about, or dive deep into this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read one of her articles in Torque Magazine. It was published in August, 2002. The title of the article said, no code WordPress contributions matter. And since I read that article in 2000, I got to think, hey, my contributions matter too. Because for the better part of 2020 and 2021, I was simply just contributing as a no coder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now I see people talking about it, and I think Torque Magazine wouldn&#8217;t cost anything if that wasn&#8217;t substantially important. And I think that article, since I read it, I&#8217;ve shared it with at least 15 to 20 people. Just so that I could encourage them to come and contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes to the resources, there is a lot of resources out there aside from Learn WordPress. But I feel like just following a few folks in Twitter can do the trick for now, for anyone starting. Sam Munoz is one of them who I believe is going to be a great advocate in the coming years for non code WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:31] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you so much. What I&#8217;ll say is that when we finally click the button to stop recording, I&#8217;ll allow us the opportunity to collaborate on the show notes that hit the WP Tavern website. And there may well be things that Ahmed would wish to add, names that he wants to mention and so on, that he hasn&#8217;t managed to get together for this show. And I&#8217;ll put those in the show notes. So if anything does occur to you in the next days or weeks before this episode goes live, hopefully we can add those in as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked a little bit about WordPress events. We&#8217;ve obviously, the whole going back to doing things in person is probably one of the most interesting things in the WordPress space. You know, it is fabulous to get in the same room as all those people. But the vast majority of what you are describing is taking place online. And I&#8217;m just wondering again, the description for those people who&#8217;ve never contributed before. What kind of processes are people going through?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it can be a bit intimidating joining a Slack channel. But is that the kind of place where all of this happens? Do you need to be following track tickets? Where do you find yourself online? Where do you collaborate online to make this happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:48] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: I think that&#8217;s the question that I hear the most. And you are right on the money with that question. For anyone who has heard about my story and coming back to me, hey, what&#8217;s the right place? I always refer them to the Core channel for Making WordPress Slack. However, if you are not someone who wants to go through every single message on Slack, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can just go through. Check the weekly article. There is a dev chat, that is being published each week after the meeting that happens on Slack. You can simply check that article. And staying up to date with what&#8217;s happening, weekly basis. The Core channel, or the p2 blog for making WordPress is more than enough. Because anything important to the release itself, or any important track ticket is always circulated back to the Core channel blog as well. So I think that&#8217;s enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then again, if you don&#8217;t want to do that either, I feel like just attending online events such as online WordCamps. There&#8217;s WordFest. Whichever event that you can find. WordPress Accessibility Day. I&#8217;m also going to be part of the organizing team for this year as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to announce the dates very soon. It&#8217;s going to be in September. That&#8217;s also another event that you should look into. It&#8217;s a 24 hour event about WordPress and accessibility. So these are events that are options out there. And you just need to find the option that speak for you, that&#8217;s most fulfilling and giving back to you. And also consider yourself important too, when you are giving back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:28] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting you described a period of what you might describe as lurking at the beginning. In other words, you dropped into certain channels and just observed. And I guess that&#8217;s probably some good advice. If you&#8217;re not sure where to go. Just go there. Hang out. Read the messages. Engage if you wish to. But if you don&#8217;t wish to, just watch and see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if a certain channel or aspect of WordPress doesn&#8217;t seem to be clicking with you, there&#8217;s always the opportunity to go and start that process of lurking again in another channel. And I would imagine that at some point you will stumble across something which is the best fit for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:09] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Of course, and I keep on repeating these to folks who I collaborate to that, remember your skills, or strength, or things that gives you satisfaction. And just keep your eyes and ears open. If you see something that clicks with you, just raise your hand. I&#8217;ve had 10 people coming back to me saying that, hey, don&#8217;t worry, we are here. I received private messages. The first step is to raise your hand, and that&#8217;s the bravest step you need to take. I did that, and I&#8217;m not regretting that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:44] Nathan Wrigley: Nice, that&#8217;s great. Ahmed, time is precious, and so we&#8217;ll start to wrap it up. But before we do that, I want everybody to be fully aware of where they can find you. If there&#8217;s people listening to this who have been inspired and would like to use your expertise, maybe talk to you one-to-one, email you or whatever it may be. I&#8217;ve got this feeling that you are going to be able to persuade quite a few people who are erring on the side of caution to dive into WordPress. So with that in mind, I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just sharing some of the places where you hang out online, where you are most likely to be found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:21] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Absolutely. I&#8217;ve got my Twitter handle, which is c h a i o n zero seven. My last name. But that&#8217;s pretty much the handle you need to remember. LinkedIn, it&#8217;s Twitter. Everywhere I&#8217;m available using that handle. Also, I attend the Polyglots weekly meeting. So if you are a polyglot, if you want to translate WordPress into your own language, which you can always do, you can come to the Polyglots channel and I&#8217;m pretty much active there, since I&#8217;m the current team rep, or one of the current team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:55] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s absolutely fabulous. Hopefully Armed, we&#8217;ll get some people coming in your direction. I really appreciate you coming on the podcast today. It&#8217;s been a real pleasure talking to you about your experience in your part of the world, and more broadly with WordPress. Thank you so much for joining us today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:12] Ahmed Kabir Chaion: Thank you so much, Nathan, and I think, what you&#8217;re doing can inspire hundreds and hundreds of more contributors. I hope to hear from you in the future and hopefully meet you in person in one of the WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:24] Nathan Wrigley: That would be indeed very lovely. Thank you so much for joining us.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chaion07\">Ahmed Kabir Chaion</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’ll hear in the podcast, Ahmed has a genuine love of the WordPress community. He’s been an organiser at multiple WordPress events, including WordCamp Asia, the WordPress Accessibility Day, WordFest Live, WordCamp Santa Clarita, and the WordPress Translation Day. As if that were not enough, he’s also served as co-organiser of the Dhaka WordPress Meetup Chapter, is a former Design Team Rep and a current Polyglots Team Rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Ahmed’s really engaged in the WordPress community, but how did this all happen? The podcast today focuses on Ahmed’s journey into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given Ahmed’s involvement in the recent WordCamp Asia, we start the discussion there, talking about how the event went and what plans there are for next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then get into what the WordPress community is like in the city of Dhaka, and Bangladesh as a whole. Technology has become a popular career option, and WordPress is playing a crucial role in that. We talk about how the community is growing, particularly through local meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the podcast is all about how you can find a place in the WordPress community no matter what your strengths are. Maybe you’re into writing code, or SEO.

The site offers a database of speakers that is free to join and free to search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When speakers sign up, they include a bio, headshot, location, languages they speak, topics, expertise, and contact information. They can also specify if they identify being from an underrepresented group. In the short amount of time the site has been live, WP Speakers has added 149 registered speakers who are ready and willing to share their WordPress knowledge at both virtual and in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>“As a meetup organizer for my local WordPress meetup, I’m constantly searching for speakers to present,&#8221; Frechette said. &#8220;On one hand the pandemic made it harder to keep coming up with fresh meetup content, but on the other hand, it allowed me to connect to speakers globally as all of our meetings were moved online. But even with all of the speakers in the world now able to present, it was still hard to think of topics and then source speakers. As well-connected as I am in WordPress, I couldn’t even imagine how much more difficult it might be for someone who didn’t know a lot of speakers personally. So WP Speakers was born.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frechette has a knack for bringing people together and helping them find their place in WordPress. In addition to her open source contributions, she maintains <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://wpcareerpages.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPCareerPages.com</a>, a site that connects job seekers with WordPress companies, and publishes a weekly tweet thread with available positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frechette is supporting her efforts on the project through sponsorship funds, which allow her to keep the resource free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s important to me that the ability to belong on the site as well as be able to search for speakers always remains free,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That way no one is denied from being able to participate. A resource like this should be available to all.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frechette plans to continue adding to the speaker resource page and an event organizer resource page is next on the roadmap.

Last month <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/twitter-suspends-wordpress-coms-access-to-twitter-api-breaking-jetpack-social-sharing\">Twitter suspended WordPress.com&#8217;s access to its API</a>, which broke Jetpack Social Sharing &#8211; the mechanism that auto-tweets published posts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WordPress.com&#8217;s access to the API was reinstated for a few weeks, the company has now been priced out of offering features that rely on Twitter&#8217;s API:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Twitter recently notified Automattic that it was dramatically changing the terms and pricing of the Twitter API. The cost increase is prohibitive for us to absorb without passing a significant price increase along to you, and we don’t see that as an option. We have attempted to negotiate a path forward, but haven’t been able to reach an agreement in time for Twitter’s May 1 cutoff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that, we have decided to discontinue using the Twitter API.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com did not detail its estimated API usage, but Enterprise access <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/\">starts at $42,000/month</a> for 50 million tweets and scales upwards based on usage, with 100 million tweets priced at $125,000/month and 200 million priced at $210,000 per month. This astronomical price increase will swiftly cull many applications, institutions, and large scale publishers that don&#8217;t have an extra $500k/year &#8211; $2.5M/year in the budget for Twitter API access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2022, Jetpack <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-social-plugin-adds-paid-plan-free-users-now-limited-to-30-shares-per-month\">started monetizing this feature</a> with a paid plan that limited the free version to 30 social shares per month (to any social network), a controversial decision that sent many users in search of alternatives. Passing the cost to the customer here was already beyond what most users wanted to pay for these features and is not sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com will be removing Twitter from Jetpack Social and refocusing its efforts on other social media sharing capabilities. The company is adding Instagram and Mastodon to its auto-sharing lineup soon. Auto-sharing for Tumblr, Facebook, and LinkedIn still works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting, today, users who want to share their published posts on Twitter will need to share the link manually through the Twitter app. For clarification, sharing posts by clicking the Tweet button will continue working. This change only affects auto-sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The massive increase in API pricing has competitors fired up to support users migrating away from Twitter. Automattic, which also owns Tumblr, took a stab at Twitter in the conclusion of the announcement: &#8220;If your recent experiences with Twitter have left you dissatisfied, <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">go take Tumblr for a spin</a> — we hear it’s quite a party over there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February, Mastodon promised that the platform would never charge for API access. After Automattic&#8217;s announcement today, Mastodon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1652511061352800259\">tweeted</a> they are excited to see the company expanding support for the platform in Jetpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Many of Twitter\'s most recognizable features were invented in third-party apps, and we\'re thrilled to see what those developers are now doing with Mastodon.

It&#8217;s becoming more cumbersome for publishers to share their content. This has further aggravated Twitter&#8217;s user base who is used to coming to the platform for up-to-the-minute news. Too many smaller apps are now priced out of providing these kinds of updates. Some users have started <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pianodao/status/1652587846690111488\">encouraging their followers to follow them on other networks</a> to be alerted when posts are published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is an example of the minor annoyances that will ultimately make people look for alternatives to Twitter,&#8221; WordPress.com user @MoviesSilently said. &#8220;Frictionless sharing isn&#8217;t a make or break but it&#8217;s nice.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I guess I need to go fire up my Tumblr account again or make a new one, and possibly see what Mastadon is all about.

Not only has it is become more costly to have an active voice but advertising has a stranglehold on the feed. As major brands have ceased advertising on the platform, the quality of ads has declined to where scrolling the app has become like wading through a flea market. Twitter users may soon be in for more changes to their feeds as any content originating from WordPress.com or Jetpack-powered sites will require a manual share to be found on the platform.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 May 2023 22:41:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Monika Rao\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14850\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/04/people-of-wordpress-monika-rao/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10631:\"<p><strong>This month we feature Monika Rao, a Product and Quality Assurance Manager from India. She finds contributing to the WordPress project a way to deepen her technical skills and further her web career.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series shares inspiring stories of how people’s lives can change for the better through WordPress and its global community of contributors.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1014\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/feature-img-monika.jpg?resize=1014%2C627&ssl=1\" alt=\"Monika Rao at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-14842\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Monika was born in Udaipur, in the state of Rajasthan, India. At that time, she recalls, there was some resistance to girls&#8217; education in certain subjects. Thanks to her parents&#8217; support and encouragement, she graduated in Computer Science Engineering. Following graduation, she went on to work for an international firm. However, she felt she wanted to work in her home area and so returned to work for a firm based in Udaipur itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monika started her career journey with WordPress in 2015, and was fascinated as she learnt more of the technology. A few years later, she moved into a&nbsp; role as a WordPress Quality Analyst, enabling her to dive further into the software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“From that moment, I decided to make it an integral part of my ever-learning professional career,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more Monika researched WordPress, the more she found it was not just a tool to simplify website building but also a platform where you could “meet new people, share your thoughts, learn from them and improve yourself through the process.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she first started working with WordPress, she found she had many questions, ranging from what are themes and plugins to what is a WordCamp. As her knowledge grew, she knew one day she wanted to be able to contribute to both the code and the community supporting it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Becoming part of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monika started contributing to WordPress in 2015 with Theme Review. In this area, she was able to work alongside WordPress code experts and, at the same time, learn the concepts of theme development. She saw this as a great opportunity to learn and improve her development skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was also very interested in testing from the beginning, so she started contributing to Core. Her first contribution was to the WordPress 4.7 release in 2016. She remembers the day she first saw her name in the WordPress contributor list. This encouraged her to make more contributions including to core and the community team, and each time she felt more like part of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus inspired, Monika delved into making the software more easily available in her native Hindi language through joining other contributors to the Polyglots team. She went on to become a General Translation Editor for the Hindi language, and has continued to contribute in this area.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"902\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/wp-udaipur-2017.png?resize=902%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"Monika as part of a panel at WordCamp Udaipur 2017\" class=\"wp-image-14846\" />Monika and other panelists at WordCamp Udaipur 2017\n\n\n\n<p>As she became involved with the WordPress community, she looked for ways of sharing it with others in her home city. In 2017 she was part of the organizing team for <a href=\"https://udaipur.wordcamp.org/2017\">WordCamp Udaipur 2017</a> and there shared her contributing journey with others. This was her first WordCamp, and she describes the experience as ‘superb’. It enabled her to connect to both those new to WordPress and those already working with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“It was a great moment for me speaking in front of hundreds of people and everyone cherished my journey. It inspired me to continue my contribution to other teams too.” </p>\n<cite>Monika Rao</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She went on to be an organizer for <a href=\"https://udaipur.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Udaipur 2018</a> and <a href=\"https://india.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp India 2021</a>. She also contributes to the Meta and Theme review teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributing to WordPress software releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2019 was a big year for Monika. She got married and joined a new firm where she could work more on WordPress, learning about marketing and design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2019, the WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden put out a call for an all-women and non-binary release squad. Monika said: “I’ve always felt that not enough women take part in WordPress, so I decided to jump in.” She took on the role of Test Lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“It was a wonderful journey— worth every second and this was a proud moment for me when I saw my name on the WordPress Noteworthy list. You feel proud when you see your small contributions in use by 40 per cent of the web.”</p>\n<cite>Monika Rao</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-5-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C660&ssl=1\" alt=\"Some of the notable contributors for the WordPress 5.6 release\" class=\"wp-image-14849\" />Monika was part of the notable contributors for the WordPress 5.6 release\n\n\n\n<p>As a Test Lead, her priority was ensuring the release would be stable and, more importantly, ready for production sites. To effectively manage all the testing, test scrubs were run weekly, highlighting the key testing areas to help get the entire team involved. The scrubs also played an important role in picking up tickets needing immediate resolution.<br /><br />Monika also continued her role in the WordPress 5.7 release, and focused more on the core software. She believes being part of the Core and Test teams is a good way to watch and learn, as well as take part in the different elements that make up a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“Skills you have will eventually fade away unless you work on them and sharpen them. So don’t underestimate the value of any skill. It will eventually help you somehow in your career.”</p>\n<cite>Monika Rao</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;I owe my skills and knowledge to WordPress and its lovely community. The best part about this platform is that it is free and provides ample opportunities to improve your skills and build a career. The wider WordPress community is highly supportive, and it provides numerous additional resources, such as online forums, tutorials, and meetups, to help people learn and grow. With the help of WordPress, anyone can learn how to create websites, develop plugins, and contribute to the community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This route for learning has helped Monika in choosing the direction of her career and in keeping her skills up-to-date. In October 2021, she joined a company specializing in producing WordPress plugins and services for online businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Everyone can contribute to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-on-holiday2.jpg?resize=675%2C900&ssl=1\" alt=\"Monika pictured during her travels\" class=\"wp-image-14845\" />Monika pictured during her travels\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Monika is determined more people, especially other women, have opportunities to contribute to open source in general. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">&#8220;Many people are using WordPress, but they don’t all know about contribution. Therefore, my future goal is to help people, especially women, contribute more to WordPress.”</p>\n<cite>Monika Rao</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">&#8220;When I first started contributing to WordPress, I thought that being from a testing background, I may not be able to contribute much. However, I soon realized that there are various different areas where I could easily contribute and develop my skills,&#8221; said Monika.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">&#8220;So, I would encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to WordPress to find their own area of interest, regardless of their background, be it marketing, content writing, designing, or any other field. The WordPress community welcomes contributions from people of all backgrounds and skill-sets. So, don&#8217;t hesitate to dive in and contribute in a way that suits your interests and skills.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Monika Rao (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/monikarao/\">@monikarao</a>) for sharing her adventures in open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>) and the late Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\">@sthakor</a>) for interviews and writing this feature, and to Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\">@marybaum</a>) for work on photographs and review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

The table showcases 108 of the most popular free plugins on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago Birchler created a website that showed the most popular plugins in a similar table layout, ranking them by number of active installations. This chart has been updated and is now available at <a href=\"https://plugintable.com/\">plugintable.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Today, I am actually &#8216;re-introducing&#8217; this project, complete with a modernized look and feel, more curation, and more useful information than before,&#8221; Birchler said.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The website is interactive, so cards can be expanded to see more information about each plugin, including the author, install count, star rating, and the date it was first published.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately 57% of the plugins included have 1 million or more installs, so it gives you a chance to see all of the most successful WordPress.org extensions at a glance. 600k is the lowest number of active installs for plugins included in the chart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After making the chart, Birchler noted that he was impressed by the stats for the Really Simple SSL plugin, which has more than 5 million active installs and a 5/5-star rating. He also highlighted Site Kit by Google as being the youngest &#8220;element&#8221; first released in October 2019, with 3+ million active installs in just over three years in the directory. The XML Sitemaps Generator plugin is the oldest among those included, released in 2005 just before Akismet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Another plugin that has caught my eye is WP Multibyte Patch by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eastcoder\">@eastcoder</a>, which offers improvements for Japanese sites,&#8221; Birchler said. &#8220;With over 1+ million installs it makes me wonder why WordPress core itself doesn&#8217;t have better support for multibyte characters.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like the Period Table of WordPress Plugins and want to see it hanging on your wall, Birchler has set up a <a href=\"https://shop.plugintable.com/\">Shopify-powered store</a> where you can purchase a high-quality print version. The poster comes in light and dark modes and is also available framed. He plans to donate the proceeds of the store to the WordPress community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 03:51:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Big Bite Launches 2023 Enterprise WordPress Survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=144179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/big-bite-launches-2023-enterprise-wordpress-survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2495:\"<p>Big Bite, a UK-based enterprise WordPress agency, has launched a new survey called <a href=\"https://bigbite.net/state-of-enterprise-WordPress/\">State of Enterprise WordPress</a> to gather data and insights on how the platform can best serve large-scale brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey takes approximately 5-7 minutes to complete and covers budgets,<br />publishing processes, platform strengths, user frustrations, custom functionality, infrastructure, architecture, and ongoing maintenance. It also attempts to gauge whether enterprise users have embraced the block editor and what other CMS&#8217;s the organization is using in addition to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This particular survey is focused on brands that are using WordPress, in any part of their estate,&#8221; Big Bite CEO Iain McPherson said. &#8220;Maybe it could be a small blog, powering an intranet or a large publishing site. I want to understand why and how they are using WordPress, but then drill down into other valuable metrics such as team size and budgets.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey will be used to create a new report that summarizes the findings from enterprise organizations. McPherson said if the report is well received in the WordPress community, his team may continue publishing the State of Enterprise WordPress on an annual basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey most directly applies to the people who are responsible for the enterprise organization&#8217;s website, as opposed to the business owners. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We find with companies of these sizes; multiple people are managing their WordPress products,&#8221; McPherson said. &#8220;Also, multiple respondents from the same company is totally OK, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is one of a couple of initiatives I am working on to raise the brand awareness of Big Bite, but more importantly, show that WordPress should be considered as an enterprise CMS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to W3Techs, WordPress&#8217; current CMS market share is at <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">63.3%</a> of all the websites where a CMS can be detected.

eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:00:00] hey everybody. Welcome back to Post Status Draft. This is part of our agency series, and I&#8217;m talking to a longtime friend and an awesome agency owner in the space, Kimberly Lepar of Valet Fame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna be talking about, um, The role in the changing value of websites to organizations. Um, Vale&#8217;s been around so long and has so much experience and just diving into that with Kimberly is gonna be really, really exciting for me because updating her knowledge for how websites and their role, uh, in the world and businesses and organizations, she&#8217;s got a front seat view to that with her team, what they do for their clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re gonna talk about, um, some of those elements that, um, an organization should. Outsource stick to their core competency and outsource. But before we get all of that, we&#8217;re gonna have a fun conversation talking about where websites sit today in the market, on the internet, their value and role, and no better person to talk about that than Kimberly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Kimberly, would you mind sharing a little bit about [00:01:00] yourself and what you do at ballet?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. First of all, thanks for having me. It&#8217;s always a pleasure. I . Love hanging out and having conversations like this. I think they&#8217;re so important. Um, and I am the owner of valet.io. We offer comprehensive end-to-end website management services for businesses that wanna have a strong brand presence, um, want to make sure they&#8217;re communicating themselves well online and need a team to support them so that they can focus on the things that they do best every day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Gosh, you&#8217;re awesome. I, I&#8217;m gonna come back to the end to end because I think that&#8217;s one of the compelling parts of this conversation too. All that you do health. And then having a, a firm, an agency, a partner really that can do so much for the website. Um, but Okay, let&#8217;s dive in. So we&#8217;ve been talking about this for a couple of months now, but I saw you posted on LinkedIn and I&#8217;ll put those in the show notes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That post, I think it was so timely and so [00:02:00] good. I&#8217;ve been kind of updating my view about all this. Mm-hmm. And you know, in the old days, Websites for these, like, and I find myself still referring to him like they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re a brochure at the base. Mm-hmm. A 24 7, 365 days, a, a year where your clients can go in and kind of check out what you do, but your post really illuminated something that&#8217;s all evolved and changed as the world has changed and business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, what are you seeing there? Um, with the changing value and importance and focus on websites for business and organizations that you serve.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Well, I think namely the, the chief change is that Gone is the, uh, my business at webmaster email address, uh, that used to be, uh, the sole, uh, provider and contact point for what websites were for a lot of companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, they were kind of these closed off boxes where only, you know, two people could edit the HTML and, [00:03:00] and change things up. So, um, from that, And you say the olden days, which it feels like that, but I think maybe even just in the past, I don&#8217;t know, probably five, five years or so, it, it&#8217;s escalated very quickly to become, uh, that the website is important to the CEO, uh, for one reason or another, probably more for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, brand identity so that, you know, how are we putting our best space forward, right? These, uh, very broad, uh, strokes of what the business means. Uh, it&#8217;s important to marketing, uh, to make sure that they are communicating the services effectively, that there&#8217;s good copy, good, uh, interaction, uh, social integrations, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to, uh, sales managers and even, um, other line level employees. Um, and other parts of the business to be able to share what they&#8217;re doing or provide. PDFs, white papers, all kinds of registrations. I mean, all those [00:04:00] different things. So it&#8217;s become a very, uh, Uh, crowdsourced, um, important piece of, of a business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s changed a lot. It&#8217;s no longer one person kind of holding the keys that can understand. It&#8217;s now really commonplace for everybody in a business to, to think of the website in a different way with a different sort of use for the role that they play.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> One of the things that strikes me from what you&#8217;re saying in our discussions in the past, particularly with your, your clients and what you see is this, when you said webmaster, it&#8217;s this thought of a supplemental thing, like an a, almost an afterthought that websites were once mm-hmm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thought of now to be in very integral to everything the business and organization does. Um, I remember talking with some of your, About some of your clients that you all work with and, and you, you had an interesting way to say it. You&#8217;re like, maybe they weren&#8217;t straight on e-commerce, so at Ithe or post status for [00:05:00] instance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, that was, that was it like, yeah. If, if the website&#8217;s down we&#8217;re not making money, you know? Mm-hmm. But you&#8217;re seeing a multifaceted, uh, approach now where it&#8217;s not just an afterthought and supplemental, it&#8217;s really key to driving the mission and goals of the organization. And I thought that was really interesting and awesome for WordPress, by the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. And the internet that. Seeing that value change, I wonder if some of that got spur on with pandemic. You know, I&#8217;ve heard a lot of, let&#8217;s say a yo yoga studio or those in-person physical location, bricks and mortar businesses go, yeah, what do we do now? Well, I loved if there&#8217;s positives that came outta covid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the fact that it pushed people to go. That&#8217;s not our only means of business. But can you talk a little bit and share what you see from client perspective about the role of websites in these organizations?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Absolutely. Absolutely. I think I have two, um, two very specific examples. I think, uh, [00:06:00] from very different sides of the coin, um, that kind of point out some of the changes that we&#8217;re seeing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, working on a project with a client who, uh, is trying to consolidate, um, a few different brands, uh, under an umbrella into one, um, during the meetings throughout this project. We can hear the different. Stakeholders in the project, throughout the company, um, really communicating what&#8217;s important to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this kind of goes back to what each person in the web, in the business thinks the website should do. Right. Um, you know, the CEO is is much more concerned about. The, the layout, how things are presented. Uh, you have marketing and other, um, sub-departments of, of that worried about, well, it&#8217;s, is it flashy enough? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, where&#8217;s the, where&#8217;s the pizazz? And then you have, um, someone else who. Has submitted copy and then it gets pulled a week later because no one [00:07:00] within the confines of the project had really taken the time to dig deep into what those words were. So that actually became kind of an afterthought, but then it bumped up in priority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have all of these different things that should matter. But there&#8217;s no, uh, kind of cohesive brain on, uh mm-hmm. When and where they matter, right. Uh, because this kind of traditional business roles, right? So I think even, even business itself is kind of catching up to how it feels about what its website is and what it does. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, alternatively, um, outside of the web presence, businesses that traditionally take place, With more, uh, one-on-one, um, interactions. I have, um, a, a dear friend who I spoke with a couple weeks ago who works in oil field sales and they typically do their, their sales and marketing person to person, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s go on a fishing charter, let&#8217;s go have lunch and all these things. And I. They are, they&#8217;re not leveraging their website well enough to actually say, Hey, we now do these four [00:08:00] other things, uh, that we haven&#8217;t, you know, we only tell people in, in person to person meetings, uh, and the CEO says, you know, oh, well, yeah, we have one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s fine enough. But is is person to person, um, enough nowadays, are they gonna go to lunch with you and then go check out your website? Right? Do you offer a brochure of services, um, within that and explain what it is that you do? So, um, I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s such a widely used normal tool now to just go to someone&#8217;s url, um, that from, from online focused. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Primary businesses and person to person, um, based, you know, formally traditional, right? Brick and mortar or service, service style companies, even in large industries, you know, million dollar year industries like oilfield. Um, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s changing. It has to. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, yeah. I think I lost the thread there a little, but&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And why not? Why not [00:09:00] utilize this amazing technology, for instance? So, you know, you can use WordPress to build a website, but then the advent of Google and the search engines that push traffic, people are looking for destinations to find problem, you know, answers to their. Challenges. And so the advent of marketing and understanding with SEO and paid traffic and things like that, back to a site where you could convert it, measure it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah. Even, yeah, even on the back end. And that was one of the things that I talked about, uh, with my friend. They don&#8217;t have a A A CRM of, of much of any kind. It just kind of lives in these guys&#8217; heads that go out to these travel routes. You know, we always live on this hit by a bus scenario mm-hmm. Of what happens if I get hit by a bus tomorrow? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is my team, you know, gonna do what have, what have I laid for information and documentation and. You know, formally, uh, businesses that have been person to person are, are missing an opportunity to kind of move into that digital age of, of finding [00:10:00] clients and putting them on a journey or, um, even, even if it&#8217;s just a, a consideration of the journey you wanna put people on outside of the web experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? It&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a good. Um, what am I thinking of? Mind mapping? Mm-hmm. Um, I guess of, of how you want all that to work. So from, from the backend, from the actual interfacing with the customer to the front end to how the customer sees you. There&#8217;s a lot of that in between, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s now all being laid on the, on the website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the website&#8217;s job and that&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a lot. There&#8217;s a lot going on.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, you mentioned two, two kind of groups. It&#8217;s either marketing managers that I assume could have different title, but somebody that manages the marketing, seeing the value of websites for marketing their business. Uh, and then you also mentioned CEOs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that to me just instantly says, Importance, like recognizing the importance that a website can do all these functions. Add [00:11:00] to not just supplement, supplement, but be very complimentary and strengthen cells. You know, if you&#8217;re in B2B cells, I have a friend, I think we, you and I have talked about as a manufacturing company, sells all over the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the search results for those are probably very small, but they&#8217;re long tail and very easily capturable. You know, like, yep. Um, they&#8217;re, somebody&#8217;s going online to find that part or that. Particular, you spell those compressors, but you know, and then so like you could grow your bottom line or your top line really easily, just with some simple things with a WordPress website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. And then like you said, for those b2b, it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s so many things. Support is another bucket of things. I think of a website is like, I can&#8217;t remember who I&#8217;m supposed to call for this. Or I need to ask a question, go to the website right there. Mm-hmm.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Absolutely.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I think that&#8217;s good. Very good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the industry, in terms of the [00:12:00] internet, of course, we love the open web post status and you did too of la um, through WordPress. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s good seeing that value, knowing it has such utility for the overall growth and seeing the mm-hmm. Importance of that. And then, um, but this is interesting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are you seeing, uh, from the role perspective, they&#8217;ve now seen it. Now you have a different people coming in with different. Needs and wants for their website. And is there someone unifying that from the client perspective or is it a lot of different stakeholders coming, going, well, we need this. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there somebody synthesizing all of that?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> We play that role where we can, uh, where, where we have been allowed to. I think we st oftentimes we&#8217;ll get very lucky and we&#8217;ll have a C-level, um, stakeholder involved that can do, uh, the, I think of as like a Venn diagram where you have linear thinkers and strategic [00:13:00] thinkers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that overlapping section is someone who can live in both worlds or at least empathize very well, uh, with one or the other. So, Um, we play that role as often as we can, uh, and we try to move people into a space where they realize that is possible. Uh, two things can be true. Uh, you can want to have a very grand strategic, um, uh, presence, you know, with, with wonderful colors and layout and good copy, but at the same time, There&#8217;s some technical decisions that need to be made. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, and some research that needs to be done kind of in between. So overlapping, uh, you&#8217;ll see, um, there are specific roles. Marketing managers I find are kind of expanding into that. Um, and they&#8217;re sourcing companies like us to handle the technical depth, um, and to help us translate that, that gray area, um, where you have strategy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of overlapping with this linear direction of where people wanna go. [00:14:00]&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So oftentimes it&#8217;s the CEO marketing manager type that is your point person. But then are there other teams or are they funneling through that person, or are they coming straight to valet, for instance, on those?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Oh, they&#8217;ll come straight to us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ll come straight to us. We work with a lot of different people within, uh, within the. The org chart. Um, but really the kind of, you have to be in a position. Where you are looking at the forest and the trees. Mm-hmm. Um, to be able to kind of drive direction or, um, get the most value out of the advice in the consultation, you know, that, that an agency like our can offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we can&#8217;t come across too, um, too bossy, right? You&#8217;re using the wrong thing. Why would you tell me that? I researched and it&#8217;s fine. No, I&#8217;m not saying it because you&#8217;re wrong. I&#8217;m saying because, you know, we, we have experience. We can give you a better option. So, um, you know, it&#8217;s, and we can see the [00:15:00] forest, you know, we know what else is going on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you really wanna use this one tool, but you have this other one over here that you&#8217;re not aware of that someone else installed. Um, you know, and those won&#8217;t work together. So, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s. We work really well with roles that kind of have essentially the same purview in their job that we have in ours as tech advisors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Uh, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s so interesting cuz you mentioned kind of in the, first of all this, the role of the webmaster. That&#8217;s, and you know, in the early days it was maybe find somebody that can cobble this stuff together. Uh, but that changing role where they see the importance and then go, but they still need someone with expertise that can advise them, should I, I can go left or right, which way should I go? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And it seems like which the role you&#8217;re, you all are providing too is offer, there&#8217;s a couple of paths here and maybe steer them to one particular path.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that&#8217;s a lot of what it is, is what&#8217;s the best path for you? [00:16:00] You know, it, you may be, uh, if there&#8217;s these three or four very important things, which one would benefit you the most? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, let&#8217;s go there first and then we can go back to the three or four important things. That&#8217;s, there&#8217;s no static list of what&#8217;s best. Mm-hmm. I mean, there&#8217;s a static list of, um, what&#8217;s good. But what&#8217;s best? I mean, that depends. What do you, what do you need? Are you interested in growth? Are you interested in converting, are you interested in education? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, those are all very different, very different things.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And you said too, like depth. So there&#8217;s someone here at the organization has these strategic goals, things they want to do, um, but the depth part, and that&#8217;s where, you know, Online work is pretty deep. It&#8217;s so nuanced. There&#8217;s so much stuff going on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. In your post, you mentioned, you know, performing well in the search engine, the SEARCHs, the search engine results, um, speed. Mm-hmm. All those kind of things they probably don&#8217;t think about. And the work I&#8217;ve done or helped [00:17:00] with, um, Lindsey&#8217;s, my wife&#8217;s Lindsey that you know real well. Um, what&#8217;s her marketing agency is love her. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s about it. They understand strategic strategy, that what they need to do and what they need to get accomplished, but don&#8217;t always have that level of depth in-house. Mm-hmm. And we were talking before we got started on the recording here, about kind of the changing roles of like, the importance of having vendors out here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. That. You know, to hire someone with this type of expertise is probably gonna be pretty hard. Uh, at almost any level. There&#8217;s obviously enterprise, you know, companies that have whole teams that do web stuff. But still probably, I think, and I&#8217;ve seen from our membership at Post Status still outsource a lot of the depth we&#8217;re talking about because yes, it&#8217;s hard to hire a WordPress professional that knows all these things and run this gamut. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. And we were talking specifically about this role. Um, my view is, [00:18:00] When I was helping a client a couple years ago, uh, they&#8217;d often referred to me, I was doing consulting with him as a vendor, and I&#8217;d go, but. But I feel more, I care about the mission and goals of what you&#8217;re trying to get accomplished. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. And I don&#8217;t think of myself as just someone that comes in, slots in, doesn&#8217;t work, comes back out leaves. Yep. Uh, I might have multiple clients and stuff, and I think that has to shift a little bit because of the nature of the work that we&#8217;re doing, that you can&#8217;t maybe just hire a professional that has all that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need 10 of those with all the verticals you could think. Right. And so we&#8217;re kind of talking about that shift and that&#8217;s where that see Vale, you&#8217;re truly not a vendor, you&#8217;re partner mm-hmm. In what you&#8217;re doing with them. Like you&#8217;re saying, stick to what you do best. We&#8217;ll take this part, these parts that you don&#8217;t do best and go deep in those. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I&#8217;m curious your thoughts about all that. You mentioned fractional, so I, I&#8217;m curious what your perspective is of this shift and what you see in the market.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Oh. [00:19:00] Um, I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s similar to the, the culture shift, uh, within companies where they want everybody to have culture, but they don&#8217;t necessarily hire based on culture, you know? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think, um, building, um, building a team, people talk about fractionals now, right? Oh, fractional cmo, fractional, CFO, and. It, it implies that something&#8217;s broken. I don&#8217;t know, just the language, you know, like fractional. I don&#8217;t need you all the time. I just need you to solve these specific problems. But that&#8217;s inherently broken in and of itself in that, um, you&#8217;re not incorporating someone into the big picture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of it sort of, uh, my kiddo play soccer, right? So you have these forward positions, these midfield positions, and these, these defensive positions. And not everybody plays at the same time, but they&#8217;re all very important to have on the field. I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t call one a fractional forward, right? I wouldn&#8217;t call one a fractional defender. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They [00:20:00] know their positions deeply and they operate with the other team members in a way that. Is holistic. It makes sense. You know, they, they work together and they do their job when the time comes. So instead of fractional, um, you know, it, it&#8217;s like a world of fractionals. Now everybody&#8217;s fractional. Um, but if, if we could just reposition the way that vendor relationship, that vendor ideal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The, the, oh, you&#8217;re a contractor. No, you, you, if you hire for, for depth in a specific subject matter, then you have a defender standing on the back line. Waiting for their time to, to come in. They know their job. They know their, and you don&#8217;t have to sit up there as forward worrying about will this person be able to handle, handle that role in that, in that attack that&#8217;s coming on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So it&#8217;s a mindset shift, I think, for the businesses, and I think it&#8217;s a struggle because. I mean, what? It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s either part-time work or full-time work, right? All of our employment and labor laws are, are based around [00:21:00] 32 hours or 40 hours a week. You have to give people a certain amount of breaks after if they&#8217;ve done so much work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, this is how the world was built. This is how our, our knowing and understanding of working is. So, uh, I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s probably a little more high level than thinking about this idea of fractional and having someone come in and tell me what I need to do and then let me work on it. Um, you know, you, you bring someone in to give you good advice and then map out the action steps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re capable and you have a team member to do that, then fine. But don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t think I can&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t need a full-time, um, you know, financial officer e who does, you know, I mean, unless you have a huge company, no one&#8217;s sitting there flipping through spreadsheets all day long, making sure that your numbers are in the right column in the spreadsheets, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They, that that financial officer often acts in other capacities. So what&#8217;s the difference, right? If you have a vendor that just doesn&#8217;t do that all the time for you, you pay them whatever that time is worth and valuable to you to do what [00:22:00] you need them to do effectively. And that&#8217;s okay. It doesn&#8217;t need to be defined as anything other than teamwork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, but that&#8217;s a hard concept to wrap your mind around when you&#8217;re in a traditional business setting. Does that make sense?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh, it does. It illuminated so much for me with that. I think it&#8217;s an analogy, but, um, if, you know businesses are in a game, Organizations are in a game to do something, make money, whatever those. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, from your nonprofits too, is make impact too. Um, but you think about that if the game is business or like soccer. Right. I loved when you said that you st you need certain players on the field to accomplish that and I love that how you said like a defender back here might not. Be the one that everybody thinks about. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, the one that&#8217;s gonna score the goal, but you need someone with the goal going so the ball goes over the heads and you&#8217;re someone there to do this role. And I, I love that. Cause I think it really paints it very beautifully. You&#8217;re trying to do that shift you talked [00:23:00] about too. You need to fill the whole team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. And you need certain players on the team to get that job done. And I love that, like valet in this instance might have four players. On the team. Mm-hmm. Um, that, that quote aren&#8217;t full-time employees, obviously, but you still need those, you need a goalie back here. You need, uh, those degrees, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> right. We can still supply you with technical depth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can supply you with design depth. We can supply you with content depth. You know, it, that, that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s the benefit of the different players on the field, whereas you&#8217;re not hiring one person to do SEO 24 hours. You know, a day, uh, or eight hours a day, 40 hours a week rather for going with the working analogy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the, the idea is you, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not any less important to have. To have that available.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, if you use this, I might just kind of continue to, to, to expand on this cause I love it.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Should we say football? Uh, do we have an international audience, should we say?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:24:00] I, I think soccer&#8217;s pretty international so we can stay there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soccer, I just don&#8217;t know as much about soccer, but I&#8217;ll say like, If you think about there as offensive players, and I&#8217;m not sure what they&#8217;re called in soccer, but they&#8217;re the ones that need to go score the, score the goals, hit the hit the goal, hit the mission that you&#8217;re trying to do. The way I think about that before this conversation was stay in your core genius. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the thing that people come to you? Because that&#8217;s the word, the magic happens, right? Those are the people you probably might need to continue to retain as a full-time employee, as part of your team.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s your marketing director, right? That&#8217;s your person. That&#8217;s the attacker going up, scoring the goals they know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re supported. The ball has been passed up to them. A beautiful cross from, you know, your tech team or your, your content writing team, whatever supports your mm-hmm. Your major goals that you got going on. And then they, they dive right in and. Kick one in the corner of the net because they know, they know the, the, the consumer base. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They know your customers, they know your keywords. They know what your strategy should be. They know where you wanna go next, you know, and then someone else helps them implement [00:25:00] that. That&#8217;s the most powerful. It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s no longer a, a game of, uh, how many balls can I juggle, and how many skills can I put on my resume? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s. It&#8217;s how, how much time have I spent on this one skill has become, um, I, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s valued as much as it should be. It&#8217;s something that businesses value in vendors, which I find very interesting. But they don&#8217;t necessarily value in, in immediate hires, I think some, as much as they should. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. You know, vendors. How, how many times have you, have you, uh, drawn a red balloon for a company in the healthcare space like me? Right? Is that really important or should you be more concerned about. What kind of tools do I use to draw my red balloon? What color red am I using? You know, is there a specific healthcare friendly color palette that we&#8217;re using or, or those sorts of things that are, that are supportive of, of the skill that I&#8217;ve spent so much time working on design, and can I make a realistic balloon? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;ve drawn 500 of them, if they look like. Anime and that&#8217;s not what you want then. Mm-hmm. You know, it doesn&#8217;t really help you out any. Right. Do you want a realistic [00:26:00] balloon then? Yes. I&#8217;ve drawn hundreds of realistic balloons in many different colors. Or, you know, it&#8217;s, I&#8217;m probably going off the rails with that, but point being, it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not valued as much, uh, with vendors or, or, uh, it&#8217;s not valued much with instant hires as much as it&#8217;s required of vendors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. You have, you have to have this very deep and specific knowledge. Well, you hire, you hire in-house, and you want someone to have 17 skills. I&#8217;ve seen so many LinkedIn, WordPress, uh, job postings in the last couple of months, especially with the flood in the market. And it&#8217;s like, must have deep knowledge of c s s must be able to project, manage and communicate effectively across team members must be able to, uh, turn concepts into action plans and must know css. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know if you want anybody to know? Sorry. You know, if you want anybody to know those things deeply enough to do them effectively at well, You know, with all of the cross browser, um, things that you need to know and, and accessibility and, and all that kind of stuff, like, [00:27:00] that&#8217;s a big, big ask. Yeah. Big ask for one human. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Absolutely. And that, that&#8217;s just defining that role too of agency. You think about what you do at Val as you find, recruit, train, uh, hire all those, those professionals that fit that job description. But would go, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be as interested doing that role at an organization, but that you find a team of those there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re doing all of that work that takes time, energy, all that expertise to do all that. Why not let it over here? And you think about, there&#8217;s one note you mentioned in the job skills. It&#8217;s like being able to communicate across team. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s your role as CEO of valet is to make sure that your team here of experts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inward press in particular are communicating as a team back to customers. So like why would you take that extra cognitive load too, would be my thought. Stick to the things you do best, the things that, [00:28:00] what you&#8217;re scoring the goals back to soccer, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re the star. Those stars do that for them. What you get to do for those that are the backstop, the defenders, like you said back there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I, to me I think that&#8217;s way more efficient and realistic. Um, because we know, uh, Lindsay is in the process of hiring under pressure right now, and it just takes so much time to source, find, go through the vetting process, have those co, it&#8217;s just extremely time intensive. And then when we&#8217;re talking to the pre-roll, it&#8217;s like, You know, oftentimes when you&#8217;re hiring somebody, you wanna find the right fit, but you, you always end up, uh, onboarding, training, guiding those people to do the best for what you&#8217;re trying to do as an agency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, I just go, that&#8217;s a lot of effort. We&#8217;ve at, at our previous company, at Themes. That&#8217;s what we did. We hired experts. The things that we weren&#8217;t good at, couldn&#8217;t be good at to, couldn&#8217;t even be. Close to good at find experts with experience and [00:29:00] expertise, pull them in and like back to soccer, I go, the coach is your CEO, your marketing manager out there that needs to execute, but should spend majority of their time on those star players on their team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then source the rest of their team through quality people that are worrying about that all the time. To me, that just feels like no-brainer, by the way, Kimberly. But you know, I&#8217;m, uh, I say I&#8217;m biased, but I just look at it from a business perspective and I go, I like this trend, uh, where that typical vendor relationship should get an enhancement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You shouldn&#8217;t think about. Well, You know, they get paid from valet or whatever it is, whatever agency. They&#8217;re not part of our team. But if you think about it and find an agency like Valet that really cares, wants to do a great job and play that role on their team, hey, I think we should upgrade that, that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindset and approach and attitude of contractors, vendors, and say, well, are they part of our [00:30:00] team? They might be fractionally part of our team, but we don&#8217;t need them a hundred percent of the time. Right. And that&#8217;s where I think about what, what you all offer, and I&#8217;ve told you this for years, I love what you offer because it&#8217;s not just maintenance, it&#8217;s not just these things that you can probably get. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of agencies. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s understanding that mindset, playing those roles on the field for your client. Mm-hmm. Because you all do. And I wanna talk about that. I wanna shift gears a little bit about what you do, because I think your approach is pretty awesome, authentic, I think you all created this category. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, but you do it to this level, high level that is, Not just, well, but if you just maintain my website and my updates and my plugin themes, all that kind of stuff, that&#8217;s cool. But it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t to me go that to be that player on the field. Could you talk a little bit about the holistic service? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause you said in the, in the beginning, end to end, it&#8217;s really compelling, but what does that mean?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Okay, well we had many iterations of this. I think we had the [00:31:00] website, health pyramid, and then we had these pillars at one point. Um, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really the idea that, um, expanding on the, the beliefs of what different stakeholders in a business can do for the, or the website can do for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of the flip side of that in the tech stack where now, because there are so many different things required, And so many different niches and expertise and all of these people that follow that you can follow that say, I can tell you how to do X really well. Uh, but that&#8217;s one out of a thousand things that your website does or one out of a thousand things that your, your marketing manager does really end to end is, is conceptual in, um, conversion traffic or can people use your website? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the tech stack healthy? Um, are you performing? You know, are there any opportunities for improvement? But it&#8217;s iterative, right? Because as you, as you grow, as you change things, you need to go back and kind of reevaluate all those. It&#8217;s a [00:32:00] shifting. I haven&#8217;t been able to find a really good graphic for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel like even the pyramid, when we had it, it was probably, it was good, but it wasn&#8217;t the best. Um, still it wasn&#8217;t the most accurate way of, of kind of, Displaying and visually how these things shift, uh, with new people, new processes, new ideas, new initiatives within a company. You know, it, there&#8217;s always something that you, you can look at and there&#8217;s always something to revisit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then when you tie in metrics, right? We started doing these data dashboards and you start tying in metrics and looking at things that you can actually measure and set goals with. Um, you know, then it becomes a whole new ballgame. Well, now you&#8217;re, now you&#8217;re tweaking. Now you&#8217;re, you&#8217;ve entered Formula One and. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you&#8217;re moving little tiny notches on the engine to get that extra, you know, half a second off your start time or your run time, uh, because you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re really in the big leagues at that point, right? So, um, but even, even in the smaller, the smaller, um, medium business sector, there&#8217;s a lot of people that don&#8217;t realize that [00:33:00] there&#8217;s a lot of layers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, good example. Um, we have a wonderful client. Who was looking at their Google page speed times. And of course, we all know it&#8217;s a rabbit hole, right? I want a hundred. No, you don&#8217;t want a hundred, you can&#8217;t get a hundred, uh, for many reasons. But, um, you know, and even if you do, it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t, if you get a hundred, it doesn&#8217;t knock up your, your search engine ratings, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, what are you actually going for there, right? But, um, we&#8217;re looking at some page speed, low times and had to have a, a big discussion about. Image sizes on a page image weight. So how big the actual file size is. Also, you&#8217;re using a page builder also you&#8217;re using, um, this thing in here. Also, you&#8217;re maxing out two PHP workers every week, um, with the stuff that you need on your tech stack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not the hosting that&#8217;s your problem necessarily, but you could be giving your hosting an easier time. So all these things intertwine. They intermix. I had an email [00:34:00] today. You know, uh, I need to move hosting, um, but also wanna do registration and, and webinars later. Glad you mentioned that because just hosting and hosting with webinars and registration for things is, you know, those are two different considerations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need two different things. So, um, it&#8217;s is a, a big. A big thread that runs through all of these things that you need as far as user experience, um, accessibility, usability, tech stack, speed, performance, you know, I mean, optimization, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of, a lot of, a lot of things that overlap. You can&#8217;t just kind of dive deep into one anymore, so you need that end to end where people, you know, you may not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need to dive into all of those things. But you need to, to understand or work with someone who understands that those are all part of the equation. When you&#8217;re having a conversation, it&#8217;s not hitting a hammer, I&#8217;m not hitting a nail with a hammer. You know, you&#8217;re mm-hmm. You&#8217;re looking at, you know, an entire piece of furniture that you&#8217;re trying to put together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you [00:35:00] cut this one part, maybe those four things fall down. Um, or if you add something here, maybe you weaken another part of the structure. What if we put something here, we can bolster everything. You know, so having that comprehensive knowledge of that&#8217;s what end-to-end, I get in, in, in my words, my many words mm-hmm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Means,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> well, we, we talked about the first is like if a web, the website, your organization&#8217;s website is vitally important to your strategy and what you&#8217;re trying to get done. You need someone to go to that has depth of knowledge and breadth. Of, of services that can get you to where you&#8217;re going. So I think at some point you&#8217;re part mechanic, part your tuner upper performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it&#8217;s like when you are trying to, to do something that&#8217;s integral to your business, that involves your WordPress website, that&#8217;s where valet comes in and why this is compelling to me, cuz you know, one of our, uh, the businesses we have an investment in, we brought to valet because we go, she doesn&#8217;t [00:36:00] need, um, development all the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right, but sometimes she needs functionality, new features, new things for the website to get done what she&#8217;s trying to get done. And that was why it was so compelling that you also offer bundles. I think of development time where you know, to try to hire that out or try to do a full-time employee is gonna be, I think, near impossible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I love that cause it was co so compelling. She might need this month, three hours of development type work. Well, they have someone to go to that&#8217;s trusted, trained, great communicators to do all that, to get it done. And that&#8217;s why that end ends so interesting. Cause I know in the health pyramid that we talked about, uh, a while back, um, you&#8217;re thinking about all, all, all the way to analytics and metrics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To features and functionality too. I just need to create a new page that has these things to, to promote my new, you know, offering those types of services. That&#8217;s what you all offer and I think that&#8217;s [00:37:00] why Vale is really compelling in the space. I wish not to get you just more competitors here, but I wish there was more people that understood like businesses and organizations need this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can&#8217;t, they&#8217;re not just gonna go higher, you know, develop, develop full-time developer rates right now are. Insane. They&#8217;re pretty, and I&#8217;m glad because our professionals are worth it, but that you&#8217;re like, I, I couldn&#8217;t even think 120, $150,000 a year to just get someone that knows the stuff. But from a fractional, time wise, I can get those three, that expertise in bundles just when I need it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. Um, and then someone that knows all the way from development to metrics, health analytics, performance that understands the connection of faster spot site equals. SEO equals more traffic equals potentially more conversions in that holistic way, I think is pretty, pretty and compelling. Yeah.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Being able to give advice with, um, [00:38:00] with a, with all of that depth of experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a story, um, The guy with the hammer that goes to work on a, on a submarine. Have you heard that one? Uhuh? Uh, there&#8217;s, um, they&#8217;re working on a submarine and, and this guy just can&#8217;t quite get, uh, the backend, the propeller work in something&#8217;s going on with it. So he, he goes through his Rolodex and finds this propeller specialist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, that he knows that they&#8217;ve called it in the past when they&#8217;ve hit really, really tough problems. Cuz he is gotta get the submarine work in, he wants to get it going. He, this is the one thing that he just can&#8217;t, you know, solve for some reason. And so he calls the guy in and the guy comes in, he is got this giant toolbox and he spends about 10 minutes looking, poking around, moving some things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he opens up his toolbox and pulls out this teeny tiny hammer and he walks up to the propeller, moves his finger around just a little bit and taps on it twice. And he says it&#8217;s fixed and the guy goes up and he, you know, kind of spins it, oh my gosh, this is great. You fixed it. We can get going. You know, this is a huge piece [00:39:00] of machinery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a huge project we&#8217;re working on. This is a huge initiative. And the guy says, okay, I&#8217;ll send you an invoice. So he sends him an invoice for $40,000 and the guy was like, he calls him up, he&#8217;s like, man, $40,000. Are you kidding me? And he goes, oh, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll send you an itemized invoice. And it was like, you know, um, uh, $10,000, you know, for my time, and then $30,000 knowing where to tap with the hammer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, it&#8217;s that, it&#8217;s that whole idea of, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s that&#8217;s valued as much, you know, as it was because there&#8217;s so many specialists. Everybody&#8217;s a specialist. So why would you value, um, someone with a, with a broad based knowledge of, of an industry as much as you used to?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, well if you, if you&#8217;re getting married and won a piano player for your wedding, you gotta take into account that person has been probably spending decades. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Learning the piano, learning the, the music. Practicing. Practicing to understand and back to the [00:40:00] summer music, exactly where they hit.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s like a, a Reddit thread with like, all kinds of stories like that. Right? Where what do you mean you, you know, you only gonna, you wanna charge me $250? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a one hour wedding, you know, well, classically trained, but okay.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, so far we talked about the value of the website growing in importance, and so glad to hear that what you&#8217;re seeing too, what we&#8217;re seeing. Um, we&#8217;ve talked about that role of the classic vendor changing, um, in a good way. Finding agencies like we have at Word at, uh, post status WordPress agencies, like Valet has been doing it for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh, how, how long have you been doing this, Valerie? I, I said Val and smash it together. Kimberly,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Valerie, it&#8217;ll be my new screen name. Um, a about a little over 10 years. Yeah. It&#8217;s been, it&#8217;s been a long time.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No kidding. Years. You&#8217;ve seen a lot too. Yeah, so [00:41:00] finding that agency, it has the depth of experience, has the team that can execute, has that knowledge to be that back to the soccer, to be a player or multiple players on your field, so you get to focus on what you do best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s credible and, and that just, I think, for me is a perspective on our industry, particularly with WordPress. But on the internet, the. Increasing value of, um, both websites and agencies that can do that. Take that down for you. Anything else we missed that you wanna share or, or talk about?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah, we, uh, we soft launched a, a new, um, a new. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refresh of the site. Um, we had to readjust our plans based on this, this conversation actually that we&#8217;re having just kind of this change in shift in market, being able to provide more core competencies, um, that are highly skilled. Um, [00:42:00] and then we&#8217;ve kind of, we&#8217;re toying around with a new version of a smaller package. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That we&#8217;re calling Valet Express. Uh, that kind of gets you a lot of the core things that you need, um, covers that, you know, the, the gives you the basics of the end-to-end. To be able to at least see and look at things. You know, if you want help with them, then you can get help with them, if not, but, um, our, our standard plans have shifted and now include an advisor, um, for the larger ones, uh, to meet at least two times a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can kind of stay up to date, keep up with, you know, funding cycles and, you know, uh, group initiatives and, you know, be able to help plan and that kind of stuff. So, um, really excited because I mean, we, we act in an advisory capacity anytime we talk to someone, you know, make an email and an ask a question anytime they want. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, you know, being present for those, for those meetings and changes and, and discussions is something that we really wanna. Make ourselves more available for, we&#8217;re always [00:43:00] available for it, but we&#8217;re never like, Hey, it&#8217;s time for your six month meeting. You know, we make it more important. Uh, Then it, it smooths, it smooths the process a lot, and I think that&#8217;s a big part of us trying to contribute, to help shift that idea of being, uh, invested. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that we love what we do, and I think that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re good at it is just because we like helping. We like learning. We&#8217;re not invested in selling anything in particular other than just being there, you know, and doing it. Right. We&#8217;re just nerds for. We&#8217;re trying to get it right and, and figure it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. So, you know, that&#8217;s what makes us passionate. So, um, you know, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve done a, a little bit of, uh, kind of adjusting. There&#8217;s still more to come, but that was kind of the first. The first big push. There&#8217;ll be lots of other little changes and things we&#8217;re gonna grow and add in. But, uh, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s been exciting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m so happy.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. That&#8217;s great. Well, somebody&#8217;s like, Hey, I need a nerd to help how all this fits in. Um, how do they get started and talk, get started talking to you all at Vale. What&#8217;s the next step?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Oh, [00:44:00] we have a contact form on the website. We have a phone call scheduling on the website now, and you can just, hello@valet.io rhymes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s easy to remember, uh, and, you know, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll talk to you, you know that any, every conversation has to be, um, started with an idea of what you wanna do, where you wanna go, and what your goals are. I mean, that&#8217;s, that makes for the most effective communication. Um, so yeah, that&#8217;s the best way. Just say, hey, and we&#8217;ll say, Hey, what you doing? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you wanna do? And we&#8217;ll go from there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I love it. I think that last part is key. Knowing what you want to do, where you want to go, and then coming to the website advisors vale to figure out how to get there. Absolutely key. Thank you. Kimberly Lepar of valet, CEO.

It&#8217;s helpful to talk to others about your feelings and to remind yourself of your accomplishments and skills. It&#8217;s important not to compare yourself to others and focus on your progress and growth. Seeking support from a therapist or coach can be very helpful in managing imposter syndrome.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Slow Hustle.</strong> Take a more intentional, thoughtful, and sustainable approach to work and life. Instead of constantly hustling and working long hours, “slow hustle” focuses on balancing work and rest, taking breaks, and being intentional about your work. Finding a pace that works for you helps in avoiding burnout. “Slow hustle” can help you find more fulfillment and purpose in your work and can be beneficial for long-term success.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Personal Brand. </strong>Building a personal brand can help in various aspects of life. Establish your personal brand by identifying and highlighting your unique skills and strengths, being authentic and consistent, and cultivating relationships. Use social media and online platforms to share your expertise and connect with potential clients or collaborators. Continually invest in your personal and professional development, whether through learning new skills, attending conferences, or seeking mentorship or coaching. Remember the importance of maintaining a positive and professional online presence and reputation, as this can greatly impact your personal brand and career success.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\">SquareSpace</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://substack.com/\">Substack</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt\">Matt Mullenweg&nbsp;</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriscoyier?lang=en\">Chris Coyier</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbezos?lang=en\">Jeff Bezos</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/finkd?lang=en\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tferriss\">Tim Ferriss</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marieforleo\">Marie Forleo</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyvee\">Gary Vaynerchuk&nbsp;</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Casey\">Casey Neistat</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benthompson\">Ben Thompson</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterthiel?lang=en\">Peter Thiel&nbsp;</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 11 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:00:00] Um, we are on session 11, and this is gonna be a fun one. We&#8217;re kind of in rebooting. Last week we talked about, um, blew out the vision and see all the options. And then, um, got some good stuff there. And now I think next step is, um, drum roll. Taking a lane.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yes. Uh, you know, when in, when in, we are a startup, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we, we ride razor scooters around our office. Uh, we have a kegerator in our co-working space. String lights. We have string lights, like all the cool kids. Um, we are pivoting. Pivoting is what you do. Oh, there you go.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, I think we talked about, uh, Silicon Valley on H B O [00:01:00] and uh, I actually had a yellow Ford Escape. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was driving. It was my commuter car. And uh, it was funny, my team was making fun of me about it cuz uh, ATO, Avi&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Aviato. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, so yeah, the, I think, and I think last time we summarized a bit about how we&#8217;ve arrived here, where the idea came from. Um, and so I, I have a couple of updates that I could start with. Um, the first is, I. Released, uh, an update of Crop Express, um, the, our, our legacy product, um, and or our lead gen product or what have you, um, that now has, uh, there was a, I had not successfully, correctly [00:02:00] implemented the constraints. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Size constraints. And so that is fixed. Um, and it also now has the, our updated readme that you and I put together from the last call or the call before. Um, and so to me, I want to add one more feature that we had talked about, which was basically a, a, um, power user bypass. Because I even at one point I was like, oh, I, you know, I need an, uh, a circle image cropped, let me quick use my own tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I went in and it like, you know what it output was, I don&#8217;t remember. 2000 or something. And I was like, wait, this isn&#8217;t, this isn&#8217;t what I want. Like, I want to be able to say, you know, real quick, like we talked about, use it anywhere. Like, just make it a thousand, you know? And so I&#8217;m gonna add, um, a simple dropdown. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what I [00:03:00] wanna do is, Like, first of all, it doesn&#8217;t tell you anywhere in the cropper what it, what size it&#8217;s gonna output it at. Um, uh, you know, you&#8217;ve potentially set that in the setting screen, but you haven&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t know when you&#8217;re actually cropping. And so I want to add that. And then what I think I&#8217;m gonna do is add it as a dropdown. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like this, you know, based on your settings, this is going to export as 2000 by 2000 or a thousand by a thousand or whatever. But in the dropdown I&#8217;ll have essentially like two x, three x four x, you know, 0.75 x 0.5 x. So it&#8217;ll be, you know, in the dropdown it&#8217;s like, this is going to export at 2000, but from the dropdown you can say 1000 and then bang, um, or something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s just real simple. And then, um, and then if we want to, we can, you know, or total customize and put in, [00:04:00] you can put in. Whatever crazy numbers you want, but the idea of being, you know, quick and easy, you can do something slightly different or proportionately different, logically different.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Hey, gimme one second. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I forgot to do this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Sorry. So we start over? Yeah, no, it&#8217;s fine. Um, yeah, so often awesome&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> confirmation cuz like, you value the product that you built, we did together, right? Um, enough to go, I&#8217;m using it, I want to keep using it. And I think that&#8217;s invaluable from a product perspective. Like mm-hmm you what, what&#8217;s there and want to make it, hone it for your own thing, which I think is such a great origin for any product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, and the whole eat your own dog food kind of situation of like, you know, I don&#8217;t want to open Photoshop and add a circle and da da. Like, this should just be easy. Yeah. Um, so, um, with [00:05:00] that, the other, the other thing I wanna do, but I is of lower importance at the moment is to redo Crop Express the website so that it, um, has all the new features and is set up the way we want it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think that&#8217;ll be a, a weekend hackathon slightly down the road since we are deemphasizing this, the website of it, implementation of it is further deemphasized. Um, so that&#8217;s that. And then, um, let me actually share my screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Share. You see that? All right? Yeah. Okay, so, um, so as we talked about, I had gone somewhat far down the path of, uh, building a plugin that works against, uh, [00:06:00] screenshot Express, which is the screenshot SAS service, a API that I built. Um, so you&#8217;ll see reference to social images, which was just sort of the project name, um, that I started with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m so, um, me and my crazy colors, oops, sorry about the dogs. Um, me and my crazy eighties colors. Um, there&#8217;s screenshot express, so I&#8217;m actually pretty, um, pleased with myself, uh, with the implementation that I built initially. So, um, So here&#8217;s what we have so far, essentially is, um, by activating this, it, it should throw you to a welcome screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It currently doesn&#8217;t, um, but it has this very cool, like the colors of the app. Um, and so you can either sign up for an account or you can log in. Um, [00:07:00] so naturally I&#8217;m going to just log in. Um, hopefully you can&#8217;t see my passwords.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> it signs you in. Um, it shows you what active licenses you have. If you have one already, um, you hit select and then great. It&#8217;s all saved. So that&#8217;s the onboarding. And obviously like that&#8217;s purely technical, but that&#8217;s, you know, all the steps involved with connecting yourself to the screenshot express service. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so obviously up for much debate between the two of us, like how we wanna, what we want to call it, how much we wanna obfuscate that we&#8217;re actually using screenshot express, behind the scenes, all that stuff. But at least technically there it is. Um, and then, um, I ripped [00:08:00] out some of the stuff that I had, um, but I think you can, we can sort of illustrate at least the, what we&#8217;ve got in mind here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and this is where I, I wanted to start talking through with you. Um, A first imagined workflow, right? So that in my mind, here&#8217;s how this works, right? So you&#8217;re like, I write a blog post and array block editor. Um, and then presumably you&#8217;d save draft or you&#8217;d publish, but let&#8217;s just publish for the sake of it, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then you&#8217;re like, okay, now I want to promote my blog post. Um, oh, let me add a featured image, upload a file, um, testing nice pretty [00:09:00] landscape set featured image update. I don&#8217;t, this might work. This might not work. But anyway, um, so it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve got a published blog post and then you say to yourself, okay, now I want to create. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images for sharing this to on Twitter and Facebook. Um, and so what I have so far in here, I have to go start, uh, whoops. Open. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always fun doing it. Live tech demo. N p m, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>no, of course this will work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m trying to write some notes too when we get there. Um, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> oh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, not you. Next. CSS js. [00:10:00] Oh, welcome. Okay. Why are you not just working? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> This is real life. Does this sound good?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>it is real, real life social images. I am in the right place. Um, I have the stuff that I was deleting. Uh, it&#8217;s not admin, its build. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno. This should just work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, while you&#8217;re doing that, I&#8217;m. I&#8217;m thinking about what you&#8217;d want in the end product. Mm-hmm. The basic. Mm-hmm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So plugin. Oh, I didn&#8217;t activate the plugin. Oh no, I did. It&#8217;s there. [00:11:00] Um, oh gosh. I don&#8217;t know. Okay, so whatever. Um, but the idea is, um, wait, I really wanted to show this to you. I frame, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> go ahead. You, you keep looking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s what it was. I totally changed this. I totally changed this. Okay, so, um, so there&#8217;s no currently no menu item, but, um, because what I had changed was started doing it all in React and JavaScript, but I was like, you know what, let&#8217;s just do this in, in an easier way. So like that, that whole welcome screen is actually like, you&#8217;re actually hitting a button in the page, reloads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not the like cool Ajay way to do it, but who cares? It works. So, um, so let&#8217;s see. We do actually build, Hey there. It&#8217;s, so the idea being that, you know, somewhere on this screen you&#8217;re like, okay, it&#8217;s. [00:12:00] Ready to go or you know, here&#8217;s my blog post. There&#8217;s a big button somewhere. Or I had had it up here in the menu item that was like, you know, social images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like, okay, you&#8217;re ready to go now build your social images so it takes you to a screen, um, where something like this, right, like this is a dashboard. Um, so we can actually create these things. Um, Instagram card. Right. So like you&#8217;ve got things that you&#8217;re building and the idea being that you&#8217;re choosing a channel, which is what&#8217;s, so channel being Twitter, Facebook, something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously we will introduce custom ones, but this is what defines the size, right? So like if it&#8217;s Twitter, 1300 by 900, no, 1600 by 900, if it&#8217;s Instagram, 10 80 by 10 80. Um, and then we&#8217;ve also got templates. And so right now I think I [00:13:00] only have, uh, like a simple. Simple one implemented. Um, but the idea is you then it takes you to an edit screen, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are on, here&#8217;s my blog post. Um, and I need to, I need a name for what these are called. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called. Um, but you&#8217;ve got, um, you know, the template that you&#8217;ve started with, um, and you should be able to change this as you go. It&#8217;s like, oh, right, I&#8217;m no, I actually want this for Facebook or whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? And the template is, um, again, your starting point, but you&#8217;ve got the idea of being that you then got whatever&#8217;s customizable is this is your preview on the right. So again, here&#8217;s my blog post that was pulled in from the blog post, right? If you want the featured image as the background. Well, I didn&#8217;t implement that, so that&#8217;s not showing, but that&#8217;s what would show, you know, in the background. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do have implemented is, um, if you wanted to show the ti the. The date of the post. [00:14:00] Yeah. Um, right. If you wanted to add a background color, let&#8217;s just make it red, right? So pretend your, you know, your featured image isn&#8217;t there. You can change the font. Um, you can change the size, right? So basically, like, based off of a template you would customize, um, what this looks like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, this is obviously not an accurate representation cuz we&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s Instagram, but pretend it&#8217;s Twitter, it&#8217;s the right proportions. You&#8217;ve got it customized on the right and then you, and then you&#8217;d hit a button that says print essentially, you know, stamp it, create it. Whatever that looks like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, you can go back to your dashboard and we would have the preview of it, um, as it was created. And so then here, or any, anywhere there&#8217;s a button that says download, you know, if it&#8217;s Twitter, then you&#8217;ve got a share directly to Twitter button, upload it to [00:15:00] Buffer kind of thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the very clunky version. But you know, again, the, the, the walkthrough that I&#8217;m starting to picture is you create a, um, anything you create in here in WordPress, a post, a page, you then have a button that says, okay, use data from this to populate a template. So it&#8217;s the page title, copy excerpt. Um, You know, featured image, and then you bang through a bunch of templates, you&#8217;re like, oh, there&#8217;s a, the simple template that has the title on the bottom and the featured image is a background. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve got the card template that&#8217;s got the featured image above and the title below. You&#8217;ve got the, um, the Post Status template that, you know, you automatically inserts your logo on the left and your featured image on the right [00:16:00] with a title down below. You&#8217;ve got the whatev, what&#8217;s the other one we looked at? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Freemeus template, that&#8217;s got the flip art, you know, featured image on the right and the title on the left, and lots of white space, whatever, whatever. Um, you know, and you and each one, I guess I&#8217;m picturing, have you used, um, migrate DB Pro from Delicious Brains years ago? Yeah. Um, So they&#8217;ve got this real, you know, if you&#8217;re, um, so it&#8217;s, you know, migrating data from one site to another. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you go in and you say, start a new migration, and you plug in the credentials and you plug in your settings. And so you, at any point you can say, go do the migration, push the data, pull the data, um, or you can save this as a template so that you can, you know, go in regularly and say, pull in the data from the site, pull in the data, you know, it&#8217;s a new day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pull in the n the fresh data. And so I&#8217;m picturing that kind of flow where, [00:17:00] um, you know, if, if all you need is, um, if all you need is a Twitter image, then click, click, click and you&#8217;ve got one. Um, but you know, while you&#8217;re in here, if you&#8217;ve got all this configured, there&#8217;s a button that says Save this, you know, as a template for every post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so then the next time you come in here, you know, uh, create a thing from scratch or load your. You know, send it to Corey&#8217;s Twitter template, bang. And it, but again, it pulls in that post data populates your template. So it&#8217;s like your, your Post Status template where it&#8217;s like you&#8217;d set it up once with a logo on the left and your featured image on the right, you&#8217;d hit save. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the Post Status, um, you know, person profile template. And then every time you just come in, drag that down and it automatically throw it on the screen. You could tweak it a little if you needed to, if the title was too long or something, and then hit print and then you&#8217;ve got that image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:18:00] So yeah, from a workflow standpoint, I think that&#8217;s very, uh, understandable. But this is around like a broader question that leads back to that, um, like the open graph and things like that. So, you know, when you paste the link into Slack or you paste it into Facebook or whatever that is, Um, it&#8217;s pulling some data back from the website,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Correct . </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of it populated by something like Yost. Okay.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So how does Slack, Facebook, different things know which particular image? Like when you create a post and then you put that image in there, there&#8217;s multiple options and dimensions with the channels and stuff. So is that stored somewhere on the backend? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if we, if someone goes, okay, I want it, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, how would that [00:19:00] automatically recognize in those platforms?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Or does it Right? Um, yeah, we&#8217;d have to look into that. Like I know that I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve played with another tool before that generated an open graph image for your blog post. Um, and. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They, I don&#8217;t remember if it worked or not. I feel like it didn&#8217;t work the way I wanted it to, but it, um, it hooked into Yost. So if you had Yost running, you didn&#8217;t have to say, generate an image and then download an image and then upload an image into Yost. There was a way that it was like that image was saved to the media library. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, and then Yost, there was a hook somewhere, I&#8217;m sure in Yost, cuz they&#8217;re real good about that. That said, for the social image point at this one. Or maybe they, they, you know, maybe they updated the metadata, the Yost metadata or something like that. But, [00:20:00] um, but yeah, that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s like I, you know, this is this, like what I just showed is broadly the. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, how we generate images, right? But I think like one of the onboarding things, kind of like Yost walks you through site basics, right? Like we would have some sort of onboarding as part, you know, connect to, to screenshot express. But then like, what do you want to buy? What do, what do you want your defaults to be? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create? And it&#8217;s honestly like, it would be a great, um, user onboarding because it&#8217;s like, okay, we&#8217;re gonna create, you know, every website full stop needs a default o OG open graph image. So let&#8217;s show you our little template builder and you&#8217;re gonna build your first template. You know, that&#8217;s your default website homepage, open graph image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Done, saved. [00:21:00] And then you can also save this as the default template that&#8217;ll get used for every post. But instead of pulling in the name of your website, it&#8217;ll pull in the name of your post done. And so if you check a box, um, then every post you create, you know, we can have it. Whenever you somehow indicate that you&#8217;ve published, you&#8217;re ready, then it&#8217;ll automatically create that open graph image by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and or, you know, any of these things we can get. I ideally you&#8217;d get to a point where, um, you know, you publish a post, you click, okay, I&#8217;m ready to promote it. There&#8217;s a good word. Like the next stage after creating a thing, a post, a page is to promote it, market it, whatever. You know, click a click here to generate all of the images you&#8217;ve already set up or add new ones or if, you know, if you wanna do it manually every time you can. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we could, we could automate a lot of that stuff so that it&#8217;s, you [00:22:00] know, cuz it, yeah, once you get down the road aways, it&#8217;s like the clients that I have that are publishing articles, you know, once or twice a day, presumably they, they might, they would spot check these things, these images created, but, um, but the likely the idea, ideally the, you know, they would click a button and an OG image would be created. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also like, if they open that dashboard screen, then it&#8217;s just like, download your Twitter image, download your, or click here to, to download all of them as a zip to then send to the social media manager or something like that.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So the reason I was asking is related back to workflow too. So you go, like, you, you hit on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I was thinking there is like, there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a site specific open graph thing that just gets populated and then each post has, uh, a nuance of [00:23:00] that kind. I mean, we&#8217;re kind of thinking like a thumbnail in a sense, but like for the social images, um, and back down the workflow, I almost go like, again, not knowing the technical part of this, but I go from a workflow standpoint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You created your blog post, you start your build thing and like you don&#8217;t even select a channel. It&#8217;s like here&#8217;s all like here&#8217;s LinkedIn, here&#8217;s Twitter, here&#8217;s Facebook. Yes, here&#8217;s Google things. And they&#8217;re already there and generated not even if you&#8217;re gonna like repost on LinkedIn or. Share, but like they&#8217;re already generated because maybe somebody does share your image on LinkedIn, not you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And you want that to show up nicely. Yeah. Um, so that was just my thought is like, first I go, oh, that&#8217;s cool. He is already thought through all the channels, but then I was like, workflow wise, I just want &#8217;em built for me. And maybe I&#8217;m editing some of those.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. We, [00:24:00] you know, I think we define some friendly default and in an onboarding or a setup, we say, you know, by default we are creating, you know, Facebook being Facebook, they didn&#8217;t name it anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They named it Open graph. Twitter came along second, so they have to call it a Twitter card. Um, They&#8217;ll be out of business soon. So it doesn&#8217;t really matter. But, um, but it&#8217;s like, you know, in the onboarding, we&#8217;ll say like, by default, do you want to j Auto generate Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram for each thing you create, yes or no, just toggle using a default, a sensible default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you can customize that template.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I think about this with our Slack community because it comes in and like, it never looks the way we wanted to, and I just go, okay, [00:25:00] we can talk about the user options at some point, but I go, I would want every channel, uh, reasonable channel created because you don&#8217;t know if someone&#8217;s gonna put that into Slack or something else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> True, true, true.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> For the most popular networks. So like, even if you&#8217;re not using it, you think about your visitors and you go, it want, you want it to show up nice and, and look nice. Um, so that was my, that&#8217;s my thinking when I saw that is like, no matter what, this comes back to open graph, like how it, we create those and then they get tagged appropriately with open graph in, in that post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think would be an excellent work focus. Then we could say for the product standpoint, it generates this on, you know, automatically for all the, so that your site looks professional, right? Any, you know, any edge case that&#8217;s gonna happen. You&#8217;ve made in the design, you know, [00:26:00] automation almost, and then post by post, they can, they can edit this, but I like that mindset because then we can say, I was, I was looking up open graph, um, as you were talking just to kind of understand that more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I saw some, some little sample images that came in. I thought, okay, there&#8217;s some cool ideas here. Um, what we&#8217;re doing. If, if we look at the bigger view and this, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m really, this is tied back down to this workflow. What we&#8217;re trying to accomplish is, uh, an easy way to demonstrate an image or some concept of, this is my website where I have done this thing for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a presentation. And, um, some of the images, I was like, oh, there&#8217;s so cool design ideas. But you think about it like, we&#8217;ll go way back to product mockups and like iPhone mockups. You know how they always tilt [00:27:00] &#8217;em. Mm-hmm. And I think we&#8217;re trying to do here, the essence of it is we have a website we do a lot of content for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when we present that in the social channels or wherever it is, we want people to know this is an entity, this is a brand thing. Like, it&#8217;s as silly as the little iPhone mockup when it, you know, or remember those 3D book covers. It&#8217;s that 3d. Same. Oh yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s all 3D book covers you created, you know, 3D book cover of any PDF you had. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like almost in that sense. This is a website called Post or whatever. And you know, let me show you this real quick, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>but see, like this right here. See how it&#8217;s got the little top shadow? Yep. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s how we do it design wise, but the intention is like these little dots are kind of a signal of this is a website, this is, you know, even, even some of the [00:28:00] updates, like I guess that&#8217;s Facebook, but you&#8217;re like, those are some interesting design thoughts for the templates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. But see, that kind of thinking is you just made me professional on things I hadn&#8217;t even thought about. Yeah. Because you get to the other side and you see. Um, just like when we went live on Goda or YouTube, it&#8217;s got the default old Post Status logo and you&#8217;re like, what you really want is some semblance of branding for the website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. And the content. So like this one right here kind of speaks more to the idea of what I&#8217;m talking about is like, that could be a template. Like we could&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Right. Well search for right where you are, search for open graph image template, like in, in, in the Google box at the top, like, uh, image template. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should get a bunch of stuff about [00:29:00] tags, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>but nothing too compelling. But yeah, I, I love what, where you&#8217;re going. Like we could.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Like this right here is, you know, there&#8217;s just a frame, like the image. Mm-hmm. I was thinking of it as like, I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a frame to the image we create. It&#8217;s kind of like displaying, this is on my website. This is Phil website, and I&#8217;m presenting it to you where like, you know, this, I mean, even the Facebook thing, this is kind of ubiquitous with like, there&#8217;s a name, there&#8217;s a logo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. There&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s something here. There&#8217;s an image like this, this template format. It&#8217;s pretty standard. People get that. Yep. But even if you did something like logo, something like to give it a fill of this is on the web or something. Yeah, well, like the browser bar kind of thing, I guess.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, [00:30:00] and, and, and you can, I mean, my, my intention is I. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I don&#8217;t want to, I don&#8217;t want to compete with Canva, and I don&#8217;t want to get into that technical, I don&#8217;t wanna go that deep. Um, at least for a long time. We can&#8217;t of like drag and drop, but we can. But I&#8217;ve made it very, very easy to create templates. Um, and, um, and the intent is to use the, um, you know, uh, who does it, WooCommerce or, um, E D D or, um, any number of the big plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can, you can copy a template out of a plugin, put it in your theme, and then it&#8217;ll get incorporated into the plugin. So it&#8217;s like, you know, VVA from FIUs is like, Nope, none of these templates do what I need. Um, you know, let me create my own. And so he is, he&#8217;s got a little, his little robot that&#8217;s, you know, pointing at. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a browser that has a screenshot of the [00:31:00] website built in, just like you said, um, or the little, you know, avatar of, of the author with their little byline, um, already built in. And, um, and incorporate those into, you know, every template that you, uh, that you create. And subsequently every screenshot of every or every social image that you create for anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m on this because we&#8217;ve been, like, I was just telling you I was at trying to do a frame for this, but I go, that&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re capturing. When you create a piece of do something, you, you package it up with a frame and then like, I&#8217;m just roughing this out cause I don&#8217;t have like any InDesign skills, but you go, there&#8217;s a frame up here that shows like, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of to, to this or this one using that. And then this is just the bar [00:32:00] that says this is a package thing. Then maybe, you know, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m only diving into this cause I really think it, this could be really simple formula to start that would mm-hmm. Really greatly enhance anything I&#8217;ve done. Um, okay. So site logo. Yep. Name, you know, that kind of goes up there and then, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>and then down here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know this be meta description maybe, or something like that. Or, uh, excerpt.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Excerpt. Yep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> But like, if you think about that from the, just these elements for a second, right? Like, we packaged that up in a way that fills like this or mm-hmm. Like, don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re not in the Canva game. I mean, maybe you go do that or [00:33:00] maybe you just put it in the stock image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that goes here, we pull this from , pull that from . There&#8217;s a link in there. You&#8217;ve got some simple branding. Oops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to find the image to copy it. Cause I. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s up here </p>\n\n\n\n<p>and everybody gets to see my awesome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, like in this, we&#8217;d only have to generate something like this. Like I could think we could get this lightly styled. Very right, very lightly styled. Pull in their logo name, have the big image here, and like I think that, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, gosh, that right there, Corey. Is a significant enhancement to anything most people are doing. It&#8217;s not custom, like, like these we&#8217;re seeing here where [00:34:00] someone, you know, has a full-time team doing this kind of stuff, but like, then we let them be creative with their own images. Hey, we&#8217;re not in that game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re in this game of packaging this content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, it&#8217;s like, you know, the, the Facebook one is the, this is the frame up here. That&#8217;s just the image. And this is just the title tag, headline, and description. Yep. That right there would significantly professionalize what we&#8217;re doing, you know? Mm-hmm. Uh, and then we&#8217;d have to stylize the, uh, generic one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. And that&#8217;s what I was trying to illustrate with like, so what you&#8217;d saw on the right of my little demo is, you know, the, the title of the blog post featured image in the back. So that&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s one, that&#8217;s one template. Right. And this kind of [00:35:00] thing would be another, or wrapped in a browser. Um, a fake browser would be another. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, so it&#8217;s, and if they&#8217;re simple to create, mostly done in, um, c s s, then it&#8217;s just a matter of somebody, me or you, or both of us, like essentially cranking these out. I mean, we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t want to overwhelm. The point is not to have a gajillion templates, at least not to start with, but a few sensible defaults that, like you said, give gives everybody their initial leg up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like right out of the box, you&#8217;ve got a sensible default, something to work with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Sorry, I can&#8217;t help myself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, the circle logo, you can create with Crop Express. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Give your big image of background color. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> When we first started doing that, I couldn&#8217;t remember how to do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:00] Yep, there you go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, even if you took the frame off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We probably want to play with these and see how they looked in the different social platforms, but,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right. Well, and that&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s the, the joy of this. So it&#8217;s, you know, so there&#8217;s, right now, like I just looked, LinkedIn uses, um, Facebook&#8217;s OG image, um, Instagram you can&#8217;t import. And so outta the box, we&#8217;re only talking about two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re talking about Facebook&#8217;s OG image and Twitter card image. So whatever their specs are. Um, and again, because it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re screenshotting, H T M L, it&#8217;s responsive. And so presumably you can use the same mo the same template. Yeah. You know, for both. And it&#8217;s like, okay, well no, I, I don&#8217;t want, I don&#8217;t want the, the Corey template. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want the Corey. [00:37:00] Template. It doesn&#8217;t work. Our names are the same. I don&#8217;t want the, the Corey template, I want the Miller template. And that one&#8217;s got a black background. You know, it&#8217;s black on white, so it&#8217;s like your themes on the right there, it&#8217;s like one is black on white, one is white on black, one is gray with, you know, little colors on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so you&#8217;re like, that&#8217;s what all of my images look like for every post I create. It automatically creates a, um, Facebook or an OG image and a Twitter image. Um, as soon as I hit publish or even before, if I click a button and say, generate based on what&#8217;s, you know, the information that&#8217;s here. Um, and then like you said, as soon as somebody shares it, drops it into Slack, um, shares it via Twitter, Facebook, whatever, like, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll pull in those, the image you want that&#8217;s been generated that is more than just your featured image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, yeah, we get into this kind of stuff where it&#8217;s like, [00:38:00] what are all of the d you know, these, this is where I guess the channels thing comes in, right? Like, so a channel could not only be, um, you know, technically, like Instagram is a, is a channel, but Instagram has stories which are a vertical 16 by nine to traditional Instagram, which is square. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, you can, you can share horizontal, vertical, or square on Twitter, LinkedIn Carousel is gonna have their own thing. Um, you know, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the optimal, you&#8217;re in Google Slides, what&#8217;s the optimal Google slide? Size and shape, like, so we can. Basically that&#8217;s where we once, once we have the, the way to present templates, we can go crazy creating templates for every single channel and every, every scenario. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I was just [00:39:00] thinking too, the option where you don&#8217;t have an image, but it creates one, an open graph type image for you. Mm-hmm. And what you want.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>well, and this is where we, um, um, we had talked about too, like, uh, you could have a template that looks at the content of the story for anything that&#8217;s in a block quote and pulls out the first block quote or pulls out every block quote and, and generates an image for each of those quotes. So now you&#8217;ve got. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got three block quotes, you&#8217;ve now got three images that are all sized and stylized for Twitter. And so then you say, okay, post this one today, this one tomorrow, and this one on Thursday </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> capture. This is just me capturing this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like yeah. Even if it hadn&#8217;t open quote, like you don&#8217;t really have an image, but you have a powerful quote in [00:40:00] here. CSS can use some brain, like whatever your default site right is. Yeah.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Then it pull. I love that. You know, some basic styling. It&#8217;s pulling in your, I mean, Mo um, WordPress Customizer has a place for a logo so we can reach for it there, and otherwise we can say, specify a logo to use across all your templates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And it&#8217;ll auto-populate. And then you can obviously drill down and, and customize each one as you, as you mess with it. Um, oras or mess with it as much as you want to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, um, so backing up, up, up, I&#8217;m creating a system for customizing a couple of templates to start with manually. And your, [00:41:00] let&#8217;s start with featured image kind of comment here to me, which I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m a hundred percent on board with, is the ability to set one of those essentially as a default so that it&#8217;s auto-generated so that the moment you hit publish your story has a handsome OG image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;ll see about hooking that into Yost or what have you. And then we can continue to take it further. Cuz it&#8217;s like, yeah, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s at least cover the basics base. Let&#8217;s cover the bases. Me and my sports metaphors. You&#8217;re that guy. Um, let&#8217;s at least do the basic of generating an an OG image, um, which is for better or worse, is the couple of other plug-ins or products that I&#8217;ve seen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where they start. Um, but they also end there. So it&#8217;s like, great, let&#8217;s take it further than that of generating a Twitter card [00:42:00] image, but then also any other image you want. The, the workflow will start to get a little clunky because you are going to have to do something with those images. Upload them to buffer or. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upload them manually to Twitter or whatever, but at least those images exist, at least based off of, um, WordPress post data and a template. A template or templates that you&#8217;ve presumably built once and then said, save you can, the next time you publish a post, you hit, generate all these images, download a zip, and then you&#8217;re not, you don&#8217;t have to go to Canva and you don&#8217;t have to tweak, tweak, tweak or copy, you know, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, and tweak and insert your own data and stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re just, they&#8217;re just there. Yeah.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, like, uh, sorry, I, I was thinking too, here, here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going with this too, is [00:43:00] I would imagine if we can create a, you know, my site, let&#8217;s say has 500 posts on there with no social images. Ooh. See where I&#8217;m going? Yeah. Install and it gives you a base, nicely styled, professional enough thing that can go backwards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Oh, now you&#8217;ve just made shit ton of work. Extremely easy and increased their professionalism. So what I was just doing was thinking about the Sitewide thing. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s just a simple business card, you know? Yep. Here&#8217;s the logo, here&#8217;s the site, here&#8217;s our tagline. Like that might be it. Yep. Just what we&#8217;ve done, but we&#8217;ve hundred Xed this thing that exists that, you know, you go to all these sites and you&#8217;re like, God, they&#8217;ve got a whole team doing this stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. We just hadn&#8217;t gone, boom, there&#8217;s&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> value, man. Oh, huge. And that&#8217;s [00:44:00] like, that to me is, um, Uh, another Delicious Brain&#8217;s product, the Offload s3. Um, and the free version lets you start today. The pro version among other things, lets you go, go back and essentially catch up.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> See, and that&#8217;s killer. I mean, imagine all these, okay, now we&#8217;ve hit our huge value prop because imagine all the WordPress website maintenance companies that go, by the way, we noticed your, your site is just not displaying too professionally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna install this and click it and it&#8217;s done. Yep. Holy shit.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I mean, and even, even taking that a little further, like if I&#8217;m. Excuse me, I&#8217;m the agency. I come in or I&#8217;m the developer. I come in, I&#8217;m like, you know, yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m building this thing for [00:45:00] you, but, um, we&#8217;re updating this thing for you. But like you said, I&#8217;ve noticed that, you know, a lot of these old pages don&#8217;t have these images, whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I come in and I set styles. It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s, like you said, what&#8217;s your logo? What&#8217;s your, um, brand colors? What&#8217;s your, you know, and so then it&#8217;s um, it&#8217;s all on brand too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It&#8217;s all on brand. And then like I meant any B2B site, so when it shows up, they might go </p>\n\n\n\n<p>like right there. They put incredible fingertip address. Like all the addresses. I mean, this is just nothing but a business card for your website, right? I&#8217;m gonna capture that for marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, and then, and then [00:46:00] WooCommerce, right? So, so every, every product you already have on your website, it just goes back through and, and populates and you know it, like we&#8217;ve said pre in a, in a previous call, um, you know, product image, bullet points. You probably don&#8217;t wanna do price, but you know, if you&#8217;ve got an if, if each of your products has bullet points or has reviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So picture of image. Title of em or title of product, sorry, picture of product, title of product, 400 reviews, five stars and an excerpt. This widget is the best widget, you know, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>what do you do? What do you see? If[00:47:00]&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go to Amazon, I want share this backpack, copy link. I go over to Post Status. I can find Corey. I say, this is the backpack I&#8217;m looking at. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it do? What does it do? Apparently nothing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just takes something to populate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing. I feel like maybe slack&#8217;s being slow or something. Oops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So do you wanna share your window or all? No, I don&#8217;t have anything to share. I was just seeing, I, I went and grabbed a URL from Amazon and pasted it into Post Status. Um, To you to see what it would populate with, but it [00:48:00] didn&#8217;t actually populate anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, you know, a basic business card for your website basically is what we&#8217;re doing. And then the on top of that is, you know, something like this, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right? Yeah, exactly. And that&#8217;s what I mean by like, so part of the onboarding, which I think would be great cuz it helps people get set up is, you know, upload a logo or specify where a logo is. I mean, Yost does the same thing. Um, and, and so you, you, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll give you the data points that it&#8217;ll give us the data, give the plugin the data points that it needs to build a sensible default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and so much. And then that&#8217;s your starting point for, you know, every time you wanna share, share a post, you know, start here. Well, no, this one actually [00:49:00] has a, a featured image. Let&#8217;s put that in. Or, you know, if it&#8217;s a, uh, you know, this is your business card for your website, but then, you know, it&#8217;s a woo commerce shop, so you actually want products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like, then you&#8217;d say, okay, we&#8217;ll copy this, this business card template, but then, you know, add, show the featured image or something </p>\n\n\n\n<p>and doing,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I mean, doing that, cross the website, um, huge, like 10 times better than what you have. A hundred times better than you have just with some basic, like I&#8217;m talk I, when I did the Google search with the business card, I said, simple, modern business card. That&#8217;s your favicon, or you upload your own little image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You got, that&#8217;s your site title, that&#8217;s your site tagline. Maybe that&#8217;s edible. And then you add in your little information. I mean,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> yeah. [00:50:00] Yeah. And, and the default, you know, is all of these sites will go and grab, you know, ideally there&#8217;s an OG image, and so you are creating one in Canva and reimporting it, um, or you, um, or it&#8217;s trying to grab the first image on the page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So usually that&#8217;s the featured image. It&#8217;s like, like we said, you know what, what kind of started this whole conversation a month ago now between you and I is the, like, better than a featured image put, put some bullet points on it, put the title, put the, you know, um, whatever, whatever, whatever other data points you can add so that when they share it, it&#8217;s not just an image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An abstract image. Oh, it&#8217;s a widget. It&#8217;s like, oh no, it&#8217;s a widget that has these benefits. Buy it on this website.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So an over graph question is, we we&#8217;re talking about generating the HTML snapshot and then making it, or [00:51:00] across the site, but we do have the h html sitting there too. Mm-hmm. I don&#8217;t know how Op grf does that, but, but for what looks like, it seems like it&#8217;s an image, but I mean, we still have the H M L code code rendered somewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Okay. So this right here. Oh, I just wanted to go down there to see. Okay. There&#8217;s something here. Basically the value prop is overnight flesh out in a more professional manner. Your open graph, social distributions, I mean, I&#8217;d go back to something like this if I don&#8217;t have a featured image, which I don&#8217;t on most of my blog posts, and, um, it&#8217;ll just pull a simple image that looks a little, it&#8217;s a treatment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we&#8217;ve been talking about the images. What are you truly trying to do is just show its image. [00:52:00] And if you set your defaults, like having, you know, you&#8217;re like, whatever, you&#8217;re, were yellow or were orange. So </p>\n\n\n\n<p>we probably don&#8217;t wanna do that, but, um Right. You know, right there. Mm-hmm. You just made something a little nicer.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Or your, you know, logo. Logo in the top right. Or, um, you know, if there isn&#8217;t a featured or, you know, and so if there&#8217;s a featured image, it shows up. If there isn&#8217;t, you have at least got your logo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, and or the option to, um, We could even have an option that says like, if you don&#8217;t have a featured image, just do a big old logo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Like, uh, you know, the ultimate guide to social images, you knows the headline, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:53:00] you know, there&#8217;s that option and stuff like that. Anyway, I think there&#8217;s a lot here. All that to say Yep. That with the premise of open, we know it is open graph, but it&#8217;s probably not the marking side, but it&#8217;s like, um, instantly create a more professional open graph presence for your entire site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something better, like these will be images too. And so like, so in that if programmatically we could say that. It&#8217;ll pull your featured image into these, you know, spots and we&#8217;re saving that image that automatically puts an image back into that post, right? Mm-hmm.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh yeah, we could do that. So use this as featured image gen generate better image replaced featured image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I mean, it&#8217;s kinda like the 3D book cover. Those were just generated cuz it was all digital assets. So they wanted a visual way to [00:54:00] do that in the same sample, doing that&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> software too. Remember they start, they would show a box like you&#8217;d buy at Staples, but you couldn&#8217;t actually walk into Staples and buy it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Album covers T-shirts. Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s, and, and there&#8217;s good examples online. There&#8217;s lots of little apps now that, um, you can build, um, Build the screenshots or take, take a screenshot and it puts it in a browser and puts it at a tilt, like you said. Um, like we&#8217;d have to play with all that. But, um, put it in a browser wrapper, put it on an iPhone, have somebody smiling and holding it on their iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, um, yeah. All those things. Like we can, again, once, once we&#8217;ve got the template builder, essentially then our imagination, as long as we can do it in H T M L, then we can create a template that does that and people can build their own too, which is what I really like. Cuz you&#8217;re, [00:55:00] you&#8217;re gonna have nerds like me who will look at, um, look at a couple of hours simple templates and go, oh, cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me, let me go build my own specific to my website, my own branding, or, you know, I. Yeah, because, and then we created Marketplace and people could sell the templates and take, get a commission. We&#8217;ll go crazy baby.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. I was just trying to skip this out of, okay, the, this all seems valuable to people, uh, to me, and I think it would be, should be to other people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, like you said, it, well, I mean, one is creating an open graph image for each post. Um, sitewide in each post, what we have here. I didn&#8217;t, you know, there&#8217;s another benefit that we talked about. It&#8217;s like, well, like for my site would instantly get a bunch of thumbnails or, you know, the book [00:56:00] cover type treatment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, then you&#8217;ve just told the search engines, I&#8217;ve got new image content. Mm. You&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve made an update to existing posts, you know? Yep. So, That&#8217;s my, maybe part three or something, but, or I don&#8217;t even know. But, um, I just see that value going. Oh. Cuz you can show, people are tired of seeing, you know, crap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you&#8217;re doing all this content work, but you&#8217;re tired of seeing the social distribution, open graph stuff look like crap. This solves that problem with a click. Yep. So that&#8217;s why I wanted to go down this of like, where, I mean, this right here, there&#8217;s a pot of gold here. I mean, if you don&#8217;t, if you have great content in the past, but you don&#8217;t really have a lot of the strong image stuff, then use, use these two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. You know, like the table of contents [00:57:00] plug in. Mm-hmm. It&#8217;ll auto generate something and then, you know, you click, click that&#8217;s made, it&#8217;ll pull it and then you go, yeah, sa saved whatever it is. And then now you&#8217;ve added an image. Image search is what we talked about last time. Image search to a blog post with a little bit of, with some automation here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really cool. Um, yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With, you know, not a, doesn&#8217;t seem like a ton of work for the user side. Um, maybe there&#8217;s a, you know, an option here per post, which is use the excerpt, use the first block quote, find the H two s, the list or something, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. And then you just, cuz I was trying to think from em, image&#8217;s, search for a [00:58:00] second, you go, um, that&#8217;s another way to get search engine traffic and visibility for your brand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, summarize it. Look, this is, we had this conversation a couple weeks ago. Summarize your content with this kind of </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. The tldr. Yeah.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So for the template engine, I wanted to get all this cuz it&#8217;s like, well these are all the ingredients that we could potentially want. So that, you know, when you start building it, like, okay, I need to, maybe for an image you can, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>uh, you know, pull, pull H two s, you know. Mm-hmm. Pull the first block, quote and that auto populates in here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Thank you for going all the way down there. Now back to this. Does this give some more fleshed out detail to the [00:59:00] template workflow? The. Workflow conversation.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m trying to think of where to start. Um, I think that the workflow that I&#8217;m working on still, still works. I think we start with posts, um, and then we can implement like the sitewide version using whatever we&#8217;ve defined. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuz it&#8217;s like, to me, the post paradigm is ex the example that we will then implement everywhere. Um, so we can basically take whatever little builder I design and stick it back in the welcome. So it&#8217;s like, you know, okay, connect to your, connect your account, let&#8217;s create your site business card. Do you wanna then use this for all all posts? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you wanna then. You know, generate, [01:00:00] generate business cards for each post retroactively. And then do you wanna get into social images? This is kind of cool cuz it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re not even, in my mind it was, it was about social. Um, like I said, I&#8217;d even, you know, the sort of code name for this project for me was social images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m writing a post and then I&#8217;m generating an image for Twitter or Facebook, et cetera. But we&#8217;re now talking about like, there&#8217;s so much other value before we even get to social. Technically. I mean, it&#8217;s all technically social cuz it&#8217;s about if you&#8217;re sharing a post, um, than it, than it pulls in the, the featured image or what the OG image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, that&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great cuz it&#8217;s all, you&#8217;re covering your bases of incoming traffic and then you can go do your outbound marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shields are up and then you fire the torpedoes. Yeah.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It seems [01:01:00] like, okay. Start with the sidewalk, like you said. And there&#8217;s an option just to make that at the beginning, to make that if no social link or something is there, use this option, then you&#8217;ve professionalized your site. Um, then you could do the per post </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Option.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And then give us all your money if you want to go to do the past ones and or the Woo commerce add-on and or. A hundred other things. We haven&#8217;t, you know, the, the marketing kit generator. So it automatically spits out Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, you know, one click generate, one click download, upload it to buffer, you know, buffer integration, um, or whatever, whatever you use to, [01:02:00] to schedule your social posts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, all those are even before getting to the post, you could say like this, just generate it through everything on the site. So there is an open graph. Mm-hmm. Image. Then when you want to tweak per post product page, whatever that is, there&#8217;s maybe in post tweaking options where we can say, update from generic, there&#8217;s a fallback to the site wide, and then as you want, you come in here and then we could look at which ones we do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do first.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. But I like the idea of a sensible default. I was like, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m picturing again, like one of my sites, client sites is a magazine that&#8217;s been online for 12 years. So m half the half the posts, um, um, so many of the posts have images, random sizes and things like that. [01:03:00] Um, but they&#8217;ve all at least got a title and an image and a publish date. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of that&#8217;s not true, but you know, like you could say, okay, so if somebody for whatever reason, shares a post from 10 years ago, it still looks basically good. Better than it, than, than it looks now where it&#8217;s just a random featured image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> See, I mean, Okay, so in that you go, here&#8217;s this one for just the site. And then when you go to post, you&#8217;re like, maybe it&#8217;s some treatment like this. Like if there&#8217;s a featured image, don&#8217;t do the generic pull in featured image. Yep. And God, I gotta believe Corey, that the premise is if you can just make your site look professional with a click, and I think that [01:04:00] this, this right here would be the way to start. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Like a default, A default image with an option to apply to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, you know, if there&#8217;s a featured image in that post, go ahead and create a thumb, you know, a featured image thing. God. Right. So with that, my hypothesis would be </p>\n\n\n\n<p>start here with, and if we can get the applied to all posts that&#8217;s worth a hundred dollars, like instantly, think about how long you&#8217;d have to go to update every post. But in one click you could essentially set a very nice, we&#8217;d have to land the design, you know, just a really nice modern looking design, but like in one click that&#8217;s not worth a hundred dollars, update your open graph. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. [01:05:00] With, and even here, we&#8217;ve said if, if, if a post, if post has featured image, you know, use it with X template. Mm-hmm. If you got that out, like for, for right now, my, my value pro for Post Status would be Yeah. You know? Right. Yeah. Um, then if we wanted to going forward, we could, we could look at for Post Status as a client. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Now, ongoing, um, when V2 hits, you know, select an image right there in the post block quote,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> uh, freeform. Yeah. I&#8217;m picturing, um, a screen. It&#8217;s like if we, if we can, you know, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re totally blue, blue skying here. It&#8217;s like, but it&#8217;s, you know, generate image. I wanna generate a bunch of images. [01:06:00] A screen opens up that says, um, looks like it has a featured image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like it has a couple of images in line, so check, check, check. So that&#8217;s three. Looks like it has block quotes, you know, two block quotes. Do you want to use them? I&#8217;ll you say this one and not this one, you know? And so it&#8217;s like, now generate, and that&#8217;s fi you know, it just spits out five, five different images and you go, oh yeah, I like this one and this one, you know, that they, it, it fits together well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, but I think we can, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>with some degree of reliability, we can, we can, we can at least try to pull stuff out. Like we featured Image for sure. Title for sure. Excerpt for sure. Um, I like your idea of, of essentially looking at H two s, um, creating an outline. And so, you know, they could just say, yep, that outline works, that&#8217;s accurate or it&#8217;s not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, block quotes are easy cuz they&#8217;re surrounded by, if they&#8217;re done right, they&#8217;re H T M L, you know, [01:07:00] it&#8217;s an actual block quote tag. Um, and so they can, they can basically just, you know, we say, here&#8217;s your template. And then here&#8217;s all the elements from the page that we&#8217;ve detected, and you can add your own too, you know, now click a button to sort of put them together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, I really,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I really like this. I feel, I feel, when we talked about crop express, it was a thing, a utility thing. We thought we needed. We know we needed, and we think hypothesis. Everybody probably needs this mostly, and thi but that was a very tiny detail in a process, right? We just got in a workflow process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got to a whole site value prop. Um, like just, just right here, [01:08:00] right now, my question would be, do we, do you. We&#8217;re doing this from a SaaS that you&#8217;ve already built in the, in the back. Like it has to take the information, send it over, snapshot it, send it back, right. It&#8217;s almost a blend. Like the plugin in some sense might be some of the design stuff, but it&#8217;s a plugin with a SaaS component to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Um, I don&#8217;t know if that makes it easier, harder, whatever,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> but, right. Well, I mean my, yeah, my, the way I&#8217;d set this stuff up originally was I was like, you know, there&#8217;s an API over there that obviously your average person doesn&#8217;t know about, but you can put any product you want in front of it. And like, I&#8217;m basically just running like a water company, electric company utility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re running a blender or an air conditioner, I&#8217;m just selling you electricity. [01:09:00] So my intention originally was, To just, I, you know, here&#8217;s this thing, it generates screenshots and then build all these little apps in front of it, or you can build your own. Um, and I just charge for screen, you know, per screenshot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>trying to think of, I mean, so it&#8217;s like you look at, um, awesome motives. Optin Monster comes to mind. You know, they are a SaaS that technically works without the WordPress plugin, but it&#8217;s really 99% designed to run with the WordPress plugin, um, for WordPress. And so you pay for a number of impressions or a number of campaigns or, I don&#8217;t remember what, what it is, but it&#8217;s something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we would definitely want to. We&#8217;ll have to think about that, right? Because it&#8217;s like the number of, if we [01:10:00] go with my model, it&#8217;s very abstracted. Um, you know, it&#8217;s per image generated, but you don&#8217;t want somebody to sit there and go, oh, well, if I generate one more picture, you know, or if I tweak it and then regenerate and tweak it and regenerate, like, Ooh, did I spend it an eighth of a penny? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you don&#8217;t want people worrying about that. So, um, you know, some, some general, but I, again, I, I control the, the water supply. Um, so we can do it in a way that. You know, you get, you get a thousand images or it&#8217;s per post or per channels, or like, we can do something that makes a lot more sense for the end user or makes sense to the end user without being as technical as, you know, per image generated May, and maybe that is what we want. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know, but we can, we can kind of do what we want. Um, the, the downside is, I don&#8217;t have a lot of information yet [01:11:00] about how much it actually costs, um, per, because I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve generated images for myself in a small quantity, you know, but at scale, I don&#8217;t know yet.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, could we, could we, and I think we should use Post Status, uh, for sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s wide open. There&#8217;s no worries there. And I can, I&#8217;ll give you a discount Post Status can pay for that, but I go, I. I want this on Post Status. Um, right. Then we go like, look what we did, we just overnight with one click essentially, um, created here, here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t know from the technical side. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like if we said just you create in there one time the open graph image. Okay. Go back for the entire site, it comes back. This is the default. That&#8217;s one image. Right? Right now I don&#8217;t know what the option for like [01:12:00] just that default business card image here. That&#8217;s one image. Yep. The setting could be, um, you know, apply this one image across site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I. I mean, that&#8217;s just saying programmatically in WordPress, that one image in your image library right now attaches No, the default open group across the database. Am I on track there?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Correct. Because yeah, if we do it, um, so that the image comes back and you are hosting it, what do we care? So it, it, we have to pay for a few CPU cycles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So there&#8217;s that without getting pricing or whatever, but I just go that, yeah, I would, I want that today from post tennis. I want. Okay. Yeah. [01:13:00] Then we, we could say, we could use Post Status with, I don&#8217;t know, thousands of articles, but, um, okay. Take most of these, a lot of these posts probably have a featured image in it on our site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. And then run that. I would pay the bill post us would pay the bill for that. Now create and just see what kind of thing we&#8217;re looking sure at. You&#8217;ve got a third here. I added though, is like, it&#8217;s one thing to do the feature, just an open graph image, but that&#8217;s not saying crop it for Twitter, Facebook. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So each post can have five different images. Right.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And that&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s where it, it gets, I think it, it, it may get tricky for the end user to understand cuz also they&#8217;re like, okay, I&#8217;ve generated images. If I share my page, I see one of those images. But where it lives [01:14:00] somewhere in the media library. But you&#8217;re also showing me these, these other thumbnails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One&#8217;s a square that says Instagram under it, but it&#8217;s not on Instagram. Like, what, what do I do with this? You know? And so like, what, that might be a little tricky. Um, that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, but that&#8217;s, but to me that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s the bigger product that we&#8217;re talking about is like, I, I kind of like the phrase of like media kit generator, where it&#8217;s like for each post create five different images and they, and download them as a zip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you get a zip file that, um, you know, or I mean, we can have a page click here to open your media kit for this post and you see all those images and there&#8217;s a download button or again, a share out button or what have you. Um, but yeah, each, each post, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the thing right? Is um, As it&#8217;s exponential. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s per post, or it&#8217;s, or it&#8217;s each [01:15:00] post. And then however many you want per post. And if, and if each post you wanna have, and this is, this is probably not a retroactive thing, um, but it&#8217;s like I write a post today. I want Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I want three different versions. Say they&#8217;re three block quotes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Facebook times three, Twitter times three, Instagram times three, you know, same, same treatment, but block quote, block quote, block quote. And so I&#8217;m like, okay, because I wanna schedule this to go to tweet today, tomorrow, and the next day. Like that&#8217;s a proper marketing campaign around a post, a new post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s nine social images. Plus open graph. So that&#8217;s 10 per post. And that&#8217;s where it starts to get exponential, you know? Um, not a bad thing. I mean, and these aren&#8217;t expensive cuz [01:16:00] we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re using, you know, cloud computing as you&#8217;d expect. But that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s, it might get complicated. Like we need to think about like per channel or per variation, or maybe it just is per image generated per post, or maybe it&#8217;s just per, it is per, you know, it&#8217;s like okay, every, every post is, you know, uh, 10 cents and you get 10 images per post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuz I, I, I can&#8217;t imagine that we&#8217;re paying a penny per image at the end of the day. Especially if we push it all back to their media library. We&#8217;re not hosting it, so it doesn&#8217;t, it shouldn&#8217;t cost us anything to ho you know, to ongoing disk space. At some point, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll delete old images that aren&#8217;t getting used or something, but, you know, we say, But how, how you bill for 10 cents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuz also there&#8217;s this, like, one of the things that I wanted to do when I created Screenshot Express initially, I just, I like the [01:17:00] idea, you know, as we&#8217;ve talked about in, um, previous sessions, we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t need this. And so we don&#8217;t need, you know, this is, this is fun for us, this is a pursuit for us, but it&#8217;s not, you know, do or die. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s like, I want to, I want to take every opportunity to like play with conventions. And so part of the thing that, you know, always bugs me about various services, there&#8217;s is there&#8217;s Ford developers, there&#8217;s the pay per cycle, pay per whatever. Um, And then there&#8217;s the other ones that are like, you pay a hundred dollars and you get a hundred things, and if you then need 101, we mark, we bump you up to the next payment tier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that bothers me because it&#8217;s like, well, I, what if I only use 80, then I just gave you money, or the price per thing went up. Um, but the inverse, especially for a lot of non-technical people or in a lot of non-business [01:18:00] thinking people is like, gulp, I don&#8217;t want to pay a dollar per thing because what if somebody hacks my site and uses us out a thousand things that just cost me a thousand dollars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so somewhere in the middle is this like, you know, pay for blocks or, um, you know, like there&#8217;s some friendly way to Yeah. Um, have variable pricing without it, with, you know, with sanity checks or something like that. So I. And I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m way overthinking it. The truth is, is we&#8217;re gonna end up just charging $99, you know, for a thousand images per, per month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and we can, we can kind of gauge that when we set it up, we&#8217;re like, oh, it looks like you have a thousand blog posts, and so we&#8217;re gonna put you in the thousand dollars tier or whatever, you know, whatever. It&#8217;s,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> um, so it, it, it, it occurs to me for a second just to tuck this through because [01:19:00] No, that&#8217;s, you&#8217;re not overthinking that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you&#8217;re making sure if you play this out, what that looks like and there&#8217;s some decisions to be made, which are good. I think so. But like, okay. There&#8217;s functionality probably, like I can go to Canva and create an open one, default open graph image. Now applying that across my site is functionality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if it exists. Or if it does, right?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Like you&#8217;d need something like, you&#8217;d need something like Yost, but you are, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re plugging in one image. Yeah. Maybe technically two. I think they give you Facebook and Twitter, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>but that&#8217;s definitely, that&#8217;s the easy free onboarding for sure. Yeah. And then I, I honestly think that we, we build this, we run it against Post Status. We run it against my client&#8217;s site. We look at the bills, and two things are gonna [01:20:00] happen. One, we&#8217;re gonna know what our costs are, and two, we will have the experience of using it and go, oh, if, if I didn&#8217;t know better, I would expect to pay for this, this way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just, you know, and ju it&#8217;ll just be like, oh, right, it should be 20 bucks. Month, build monthly.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Now, as I, as I thought about that, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll have to go back to Yos, but I go the ability to take any image I have, whether OMG does this or not, but apply it across the site. And it&#8217;s probably not one, it&#8217;s three. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we&#8217;re talking about, it&#8217;s Google showing up, it&#8217;s Facebook, Twitter, you know, so there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s four images to say or something. Now two and I, huh? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> There really is only two cuz every, I&#8217;m I, as far as I know, everybody [01:21:00] uses open graph image. Twitter&#8217;s the only one that&#8217;s broken away. Uh oh. Like I just Googled, you know, uh, LinkedIn open graph. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the article that comes up says, make your website shareable on LinkedIn. And it says below are the OG tags. And it&#8217;s just, Facebook&#8217;s OG tags. So LinkedIn just uses, use it, not just, but LinkedIn uses the same as Facebook.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Then let me, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking. This could just, this functionality No, no. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create an image, but just a plug in type functionality of see this image, apply it, cross the site to blogs, to everything on my site so that it&#8217;s my reference sensation of my site. If it doesn&#8217;t have other, other things that feels like that could be a [01:22:00] free, free option. A hundred percent. And that&#8217;s valuable to, um, just going, yeah, I went to Camba, I got all my outputs, I wanna put &#8217;em in and I just wanna say, apply that to my site so that instantly everything looks better if it&#8217;s generic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. But that&#8217;s like probably a free option for us. Now where I go value though, is right here of I value all of my posts. Not having the generic, but having a minimal treatment. Generat an image for that post that has, if it has a featured image, put a featured image over here. Right. Something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, that&#8217;s interesting to me. I think that&#8217;s what we should play with and figure out that. Mm-hmm. Because I go, I want that today and if it costs me $500, I&#8217;d do it. Hmm. If, if basic like, think about doing that [01:23:00] from cama, it&#8217;s gonna take you a month. Oh yeah. Uploading, creating images, downloading and all this stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s worth easily $500 for me today of any post on the site has this kind of image treatment with a click. And it&#8217;s in the appropriate image graph now. Just told Google and my media library is under these pages or new images. I&#8217;ve just updated my content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Like now I&#8217;m kind of thinking Corey, like that&#8217;s some version of, this is actually B one that&#8217;s free, but, but this could be, you know, a small, I&#8217;m guessing small free plugin. Upload your image. It&#8217;s applied generically through your site with some real simple, you know, business card template, but this, or use cam [01:24:00] and just put it up there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is powerful to me because I go every,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> it&#8217;s a huge time saver. That&#8217;s the, yeah. Time and money, right is, yeah. Like you said, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re auto generating, And especially if you&#8217;re auto generating in bulk. Yeah. Okay, let&#8217;s sign off. I&#8217;ll go build it. Okay. I&#8217;ll have it to you in 15 minutes. Just kidding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have an auto generate button for that? Yeah, it&#8217;s called chat. G p t.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Uh, yeah. Hey, that&#8217;s valuable. Um, what do I need to be thinking about for that? Because I&#8217;m trying to put, I have the post that it&#8217;s head on, but like, okay. What would I want is to be able to go through auto generate headline, an expert excerpt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it has a featured image, put it on there [01:25:00] for each post and be at in my media library attached to my post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a lot of value. Am I missing something here? Like I go mm-hmm. Something with a button click. You could pretty much create new images packaged, um, in a way. And then telling Google in the net social networks, this now exists for this piece of content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m having a hard time saying, why wouldn&#8217;t I want that right now? Like I&#8217;ve right for some money, I&#8217;ve instantly updated and created new content for every post on my site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s. I know themes used the featured image, but we, we&#8217;d wanna be careful replacing the featured image. But you go like, a lot of the themes have those, well, like the Frames blog have those little, well, you know, [01:26:00] a lot of sites don&#8217;t even have that.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> The hero. Yep.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> The hero, the thumbnail, whatever that is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where it&#8217;s like in the category archive, you&#8217;ve instantly shown a nice basic modern design treatment with your colors and for everything.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. Yeah. And it, I mean, and, and we&#8217;d have a button that says, um, you know, swap for featured image. Like we&#8217;ve taken your featured image, we&#8217;ve put some text over it, you know, if you like this, make your featured image better. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then it just one in, one out. We&#8217;re not gonna delete your featured image cuz you could regenerate, want to regenerate the image again or something. But it would, yeah, like, so we&#8217;ll give you that option. Like you probably don&#8217;t want to do it by default. Um, but, so yeah, I, for now, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s wrap up for today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I, we went over. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> No, it&#8217;s fine. [01:27:00] Um, you saw my note. I put a couple of things in Slack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, I was in Never Neverland. I like it when you&#8217;re in Never Neverland.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yes. We should get that. Um,&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> cool. Um, but I think, yeah, I think at this point, like I&#8217;m pretty close to something that does something and, and let&#8217;s have that something, that Alpha version run against. I mean, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s get, create a Post Status staging or something. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but see what it, you know, Let&#8217;s watch it run because there&#8217;s other technical things. I wanna see, like we said, pricing. I wanna see how long it takes, you know, stuff like that. So let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s get into, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s solve the problem for one and for 10 and for a hundred. And then, [01:28:00] you know, start to, and we&#8217;ll continue to talk about the actual product and we&#8217;ll just, and, you know, we&#8217;re designing a really nice engine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s, we&#8217;ll also talk about what the car looks like and then we can drop the engine in the car.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So there&#8217;s 6,800 posts in, in Post says blog post only. Okay.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That would be perfect. That&#8217;s a great number. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That would be </p>\n\n\n\n<p>okay. Okay, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll be thinking about what the card I wanted to look like, but I think it&#8217;s title featured image, the standard branding.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, and yeah, and like I said, I mean, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve already, I have, I couldn&#8217;t show you, but I have two, you know, two very basic templates started. They are so easy to create. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can, we can create 10, you know, in an hour. Just going, [01:29:00] oh, put this here, here, here. Cool. That&#8217;s one. Put this here, here, here. Background image two, you know, cuz I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve, for better or worse, like, I went down the rabbit hole of abstracting a lot of this stuff out. So we can just say, I want a color, you know, I want background color, I want text color, I want, so it&#8217;s just color, color, color, color. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Font, font, font, font, on and on. So, We can, we can even sit down, like once we have one basic thing that we know is running, working, then you and I could, you know, have one of these calls where we just knock together 10 different templates. Okay?&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Thanks man. I lost track of time. Thanks for going&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> over. No, it&#8217;s fine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but yeah, so stay on for a minute. Okay. Session 11.

After some introductory words, we‘ll focus on the new BuddyPress purpose that I believe we should adopt for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven‘t forgotten that, at the end of 2021, we had some conversations (<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/support/topic/what-is-the-most-important-thing-buddypress-is-missing/\">here</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-plugin-usage-declining-remaining-contributors-discuss-path-forward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>) about this « difficult to answer with a few words » question. These happened once the <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2022/09/lets-talk-about-us-buddypress/\">plugin’s active installs statistics went a bit under 200.000</a>. Our WordPress plugin directory page’s “active installations” value suddenly changed from “200,000+” to “100,000+”—though the actual number only changed from just over 200.000 to about 190.000 active installation&#8211;making this decline seem pretty spectacular <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4c9.png\" alt=\"📉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. It was nevertheless a great opportunity to think together about how the plugin should evolve now that <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2023/03/lets-celebrate-buddypress-15th-anniversary-welcome-the-first-attachments-add-on-features/\">15 years</a> have passed since its birth.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-329306\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div><span class=\"dashicons dashicons-buddicons-buddypress-logo\"></span></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let me offer some thanks on behalf of the BuddyPress development team:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thanks a lot to the women &amp; men who are trusting the plugin to power their community WordPress sites <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60d.png\" alt=\"😍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thanks a million to the contributors who share some of their free time, energy or resources with us to maintain the plugin <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png\" alt=\"🤝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Warm gratitude to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://automattic.com\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a> for providing BuddyPress’s web site, our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dev’updates</a> blog as well as our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Trac environment</a>, these tools are essential to BuddyPress &amp; its community <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1faf6.png\" alt=\"🫶\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finally huge thanks to everyone of us, members of the team; for 15 years we’ve been working together to maintain &amp; improve this free and open-source plugin <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png\" alt=\"💪\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your feedback: the main points</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe we can organize your ideas in 5 categories:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What should be our main purpose(s)?</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>How should the plugin be organized?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What features should BuddyPress include?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What improvements does the plugin UI need?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can we attract and keep new contributors?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As introduced earlier into this post, let‘s wrap up your feedback about the first topic and explain how they contributed to what I think should be our new main purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key feedback about BuddyPress’s purpose</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>« Communities organized around a product »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« It is the perfect choice for <strong>company intranets</strong> »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« <strong>Private</strong>, <strong>secure</strong> social network just for your friends/family »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« Sites for educational courses, coaching »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;« It would have been the collaboration platform of choice over the pandemic had the <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong> been there »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« <strong>Needs a more specific mission</strong> and purpose: BuddyVerse »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« <strong>Too </strong><strong>Developer-focused</strong> »</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, here’s our site’s tagline about BuddyPress’s purpose: « <em>Fun &amp; flexible software for online communities, teams, and groups. BuddyPress helps you build any kind of community website using WordPress, with member profiles, activity streams, user groups, messaging, and more</em>. »</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the last point as it contains negative implications: « <strong>too developer-focused</strong> » <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2699.png\" alt=\"⚙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we have third party plugins or themes in mind at some point during our coding process: our main concern about these is potential compatibility issues. That’s why when we have a doubt, we put backward compatibility code into the plugin. It’s also true we used to primarily think about BuddyPress as a plugin you can build great things on top of it; that’s reflected in the « helps you build » part of our tagline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model is interesting as long as third-party plugin authors are very involved with contributing to BuddyPress. However, they do not share their energy &amp; time with us as often as was common in BuddyPress’s early years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe <strong>we now need to satisfy end-users first</strong> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f468-200d-1f469-200d-1f467-200d-1f466.png\" alt=\"👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. A reproach I often read in reviews posted about the plugin on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/buddypress/reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org</a> is: « BuddyPress is not including the basic features any end-user would expect so that it&#8217;s needed to install other third party plugins ». And a majority of reviewers are then regularly complaining: « a lot of these plugins have not been updated for a while or worse are no longer maintained ». <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png\" alt=\"⚠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> The problem then is that using these plugins can increase WordPress sites security threats even if BuddyPress benefits from the WP hacker1 program. Being able to <strong>run a safe community</strong> is very important: we don&#8217;t settle in a neighborhood when our security is at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Privacy</strong> is a basic need we absolutely have to satisfy <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f510.png\" alt=\"🔐\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. Yes, BuddyPress can be an interesting choice for company intranets, social stores, family circles or social learning platforms as soon as we can <strong>easily lock some areas of the community pages</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About federating WordPress site owners updates into a BuddyVerse <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f30d.png\" alt=\"🌍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />, it&#8217;s an amazing idea I already heard of 5 years ago during the WordCamp Europe 2017. As WordPress is powering around 40% of Internet sites, I guess there&#8217;s an interesting potential, but I believe<strong> we need a lot more contributors</strong> to master the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub protocol</a> (extending the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub WordPress plugin</a>?) or the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://matrix.org\" target=\"_blank\">Matrix standard</a> and required developments to allow 2 or more WordPress instances to follow each others or more globally to achieve a <strong>distributed BuddyPress network</strong>. To avoid missing the « <em>we figured out being chained into social media owned by capricious billionaires was masochist</em>ic » opportunity, maybe we can make a first step into this direction and reach something approaching improving how we deal with RSS feeds &amp; implementing <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/\" target=\"_blank\">Webmentions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude this part of your feedbacks review, I think we need to work in directions so that you can use BuddyPress to:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">« Get together safely, <strong>in </strong><strong>your own way</strong>, in WordPress ».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the « <strong>own</strong> » word is fundamental: compared to social media <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b8.png\" alt=\"💸\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> where you lose ownership over your data, where this information is used to earn money off your content. <strong>With BuddyPress, you control every aspect of your community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The first two concrete steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress 12.0, our next major version, will introduce a huge, necessary improvement to make many other improvements possible. We are replacing our Legacy URL parser with a new BP Rewrites API (which is based on the WordPress Rewrite API). We are completely restructuring the way BuddyPress analyzes URLs to decide whether to load community content and what is being requested. The benefits for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Every BuddyPress URL will be customizable into your language (I heard it was important for SEO).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>BuddyPress will finally support plain permalinks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>BP URL parsing will be more reliable &amp; fully compliant with WordPress best practices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this change is potentially a breaking one for plugins that won‘t be updated, we‘ll also build a BP Classic plugin, so you‘ll be able to continue enjoying these slow-to-update plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, <strong>12.0 will also include a new community visibility feature giving you the ability to use BuddyPress to power your private communities</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We‘ll take more time than usual to reach this 12th milestone. We need to <a href=\"https://developer.buddypress.org/plugins/\">document the needed changes plugin authors</a> will need to perform as well as inform our users what they should do if something goes wrong with the 12.0 upgrade process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12.0 final release is slated for October 30, and we welcome everyone wishing to <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/participate-and-contribute/\">get involved</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How should we organize the plugin?</strong> That’s the second category of your feedback, and we’ll talk about it in the next post of this series.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Props</strong>: many thanks to <a class=\"bp-suggestions-mention\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/dcavins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@dcavins</a> for his review <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f970.png\" alt=\"🥰\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 20:37:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mathieu Viet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"Do The Woo Community: The Future of Tax Compliance for Your WooCommerce Clients\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74958\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://dothewoo.io/future-of-tax-compliance-woocommerce-clients/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:405:\"<p>In the future with tax compliance for your clients, returns, automation and headless are in the forefront.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/future-of-tax-compliance-woocommerce-clients/\">The Future of Tax Compliance for Your WooCommerce Clients</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 11:03:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Kirki Plugin Up for Sale, Development Discontinued\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=144071\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/kirki-plugin-up-for-sale-development-discontinued\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2468:\"<p>David Vongries, developer of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/kirki/\">Kirki Customizer Framework</a> plugin, <a href=\"https://kirki.org/blog/goodbye/\">announced</a> he is sunsetting the product and will discontinue development and support. Vongries bought the plugin in 2020 from its original creator, Ari Stathopoulos, and grew its user base from 400K to 600K active installs. He <a href=\"https://kirki.org/blog/kirki-pro-is-now-live/\">launched Kirki PRO</a> with additional extensions in March 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I first acquired Kirki in early 2020, I had big plans for it,&#8221; Vongries said. &#8220;Although we were able to execute on step one of the 2-step plan we had for the plugin, as time went on, I lost passion for the project mainly due to the direction WordPress core has taken with Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s clear to me now that I was too ambitious in taking on the project.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kirki&#8217;s customizer framework enabled theme authors to add custom controls and advanced features to the customizer, including the ability to style it, and add a custom header. Although block theme adoption has been a slow process, the death knell for the Customizer rang years ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, Vongries said that exploring how Kirki could potentially extend Gutenberg was one of his goals. Stathopoulos had also discussed the possibility of moving away from the customizer to work with full-site editing and global styles, helping themes that use Kirki transition to global styles.

Core contributor Jonathan Bossenger started the project in 2019 with a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/08/05/feature-project-proposal-wp-notify/\">proposal</a> to build a unified notification center in WordPress that would replace the chaos caused by developers hooking into admin notices, which was not designed to be a notification system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest 0.2.0 update of the feature plugin, contributors have implemented a more robust JavaScript-based system for standardizing how notifications appear in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What originally started as a<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/21/request-for-feedback-feature-notifications-proof-of-concept/\"> UX proof of concept</a> has evolved into a more sophisticated JS-based system for displaying notifications based on serialized data,&#8221; WordPress core contributor Joe Bailey-Roberts said. &#8220;At the moment this uses static dummy data, however in a future update this will interface with the upcoming REST controllers to display persistent data.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The project is restructuring its leadership with Bossenger stepping down as the lead and Bailey-Roberts taking over the position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WP Feature Notifications currently exists as a feature plugin, its contributors are intent on seeing it merged into core when ready, instead of kept as a canonical plugin. They are eager to see the project&#8217;s design and functionality work in concert with the planned modernization of the admin as part of Gutenberg Phase 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Notification functionality is indeed fundamental, and already in constant use via the admin_notices hook, a workaround that has major issues of standardization and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50486\">accessibility</a>,&#8221; Bailey-Roberts said. &#8220;The new API needs to be universal, and available by default, otherwise admin_notices will remain the de facto option.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors plan to remove the demo content from the plugin in version 0.3.0 and make it into an MVP (minimum viable product) with a functional notification system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The next (and largest) piece of the puzzle is persistent database storage of notification data,&#8221; Bailey-Roberts said. &#8220;We’re working on finalizing the proposed schema, as well as discussing other issues such as retention, translations, multisite support, and more.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to keep moving the project forward, contributors are seeking a partnership with a core committer for guidance on preparing the plugin to be a good candidate fore core, as well as additional contributors with PHP and SQL expertise. The feature plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wp-feature-notifications\">available on GitHub</a> for testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A solution for notifications in WordPress is critical for improving the admin experience for every user. A standardized way of displaying notifications will make site management a more predictable and less cognitively draining task. The WP Feature Notifications project is still in the early stages but it has some momentum and it needs help. Contributors can join the team&#8217;s weekly office hours on WP Slack in the<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C2K1C71FE\"> #feature-notifications channel</a>, and the project will also have representation at WordCamp Europe&#8217;s Contributor Day.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 14:03:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: #73 – Ryan Welcher on Using the create-block Tool to Quickly Scaffold a New Block Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=144046\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/73-ryan-welcher-on-using-the-create-block-tool-to-quickly-scaffold-a-new-block-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51496:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how a block plugin creation can be speeded up with the create-block tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Ryan Welcher. Ryan is a developer advocate sponsored by Automattic. He has been developing with WordPress since 2009. And before becoming a developer advocate, worked for agencies large and small, and as a freelancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been using WordPress for any length of time, you&#8217;ll have come across the new paradigm for content creation, blocks. Every part of your website can now be created and amended as a block. Pages, posts, text, images, headers, footers, navigation, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has widened what&#8217;s possible for those who don&#8217;t want to mess around with the code of their website. You can add in blocks for almost anything. And change how it looks and behaves from within the block editor interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an excellent move forward, but there&#8217;s still an impediment for non-technical people because creating a block of your own is difficult. If you are able to use the selection of blocks that ship with WordPress Core, or you can find a third party block which does what you need, great. But if you need something specific, you&#8217;re going to have to create your own block solution. And that can be hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan is on the podcast today to tell us about the create-block tool. And how it can make your pathway towards block creation a little easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off talking about Ryan&#8217;s background and how he became interested in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move on to how he thinks that the adoption of blocks is becoming more widespread given the maturing of tools and learning materials available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then turns to how the create-block tool can help you scaffold your blocks. It&#8217;s not a tool which is going to build the blocks for you, but it will help you set up the environment and build process, which you need to get started. Really it&#8217;s all about saving you time and effort on things which don&#8217;t really you get you building your blocks, but which you need to do that work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that you&#8217;ll need to have once the tool has you up and running. What level of expertise do you need, and is the tool under continual development?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spend a few moments talking about the live streaming which Ryan does each week in which he lived code solutions to view as block-based problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve thought about creating your own blocks but have been put off by the technical barrier, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ryan Welcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Ryan Welcher. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:29] Ryan Welcher: Hello. Thank you for having me. Super excited to be here today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m really, really happy to have you on the podcast today, because I really need to learn what it is that you are going to be talking about. We&#8217;re going to be talking a great deal about the Create Block Tool, how it works, what it does, how to make it come onto a local computer near you. But before we do that, I wonder Ryan, if you wouldn&#8217;t mind spending just a few moments telling us a little bit about yourself, your backstory, your relationship with WordPress, who you work for, all of that&#8217;s good stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, so I am a developer advocate. I&#8217;m sponsored by Automattic. So I&#8217;m part of the five for the future, giving back to the open source project that is WordPress. I&#8217;ve been a developer since about 2004. I started doing flash development. I don&#8217;t know if anyone remembers flash development, but I started doing that. In 2009 I was introduced to WordPress and I haven&#8217;t looked back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve worked at, I was a freelancer. I worked at small agencies, large agencies, shout out to 10up, which an amazing place to work, I love that place. Yeah, and so I&#8217;ve just found my way into Dev Rel, which is a very, very fun and exciting and challenging, and way different than what I was doing two years ago. But it&#8217;s been great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] Nathan Wrigley: Can I go a little bit off piste, against the flow of what the conversation will be about? Could you just tell us a little bit about the way that that job works? So you are sponsored by Automattic, is that a full-time thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] Ryan Welcher: It is. I work on a team of Dev Rel, of developer advocates, and our job is to appear on podcasts, speak at conferences, create awareness and work on documentation and do all this sort of stuff. But, sorry, yeah, I cut you off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: No, no, it was really just, I&#8217;m curious as to how that role is advertised. Was it something that you saw in like a WordPress space, and you applied for it? And also who is it that decides what your roster of work is? Do you have autonomy there or is there a panel of people that you have to report to and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] Ryan Welcher: Those are great questions. So it was a role that was advertised. I saw someone mention it, and I think the WordPress Slack, the Make Slack. I applied and went through the process there. As far as the work that we do, it&#8217;s kind of a mixed bag. We do have a fair amount of autonomy. This is a newer team. There&#8217;s six of us for the entire internet, so. Sorry, for 43% of the internet. So there&#8217;s a lot of work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a focus on improving documentation. That&#8217;s kind of our number one focus at the moment. But, there&#8217;s a lot of smaller projects as well. I try to maintain the Gutenberg Examples repository, which is a GitHub repository that shows examples of working with blocks and some of the various things that you can do with Gutenberg, like a custom admin page that interacts with the data stores in Gutenberg and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I was just at WordCamp Asia, which was an amazing experience. I wasn&#8217;t speaking, but I was meeting with lots of developers and just kind of like schmoozing. I get to schmooze professionally now, which is a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:16] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s amazing. I do wonder since Gutenberg dropped several years ago now. I mean, it really is, it has been going for many, many years. But there really was a fork in the road for WordPress there, and there was a little bit of tension. Some people didn&#8217;t see the purpose of Gutenberg and ultimately blocks. And I do wonder if roles like yours became more important after that. Do you feel like a need to message and get the word out and educate more after Gutenberg dropped?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] Ryan Welcher: I think yes. I also think that the tech industry, I mean, there&#8217;s always been developer advocates. I remember I went to a flash conference years and years and years ago, and I saw someone speak there who was, what were they called at the time? A platform evangelist for Adobe and was basically doing Dev Rel stuff, like showing what you can do with flash and the new features and cool stuff. So it&#8217;s been around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think now people are really starting to see the benefits of it. Especially when you have a large community like WordPress. There&#8217;s so many people. And having people who can help, you know, the education piece. And there&#8217;s a lot of yelling into the void without people like me and our team to hear what you&#8217;re saying. Like, you know, the documentation needs work. Okay, well someone needs to work on that. Now that&#8217;s my job to work on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I definitely think that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s benefits to Dev Rel in any industry for sure. But I think, to an extent, when 5.0 came out, I think that sort of showed the need for someone to come in and say, hey, you know, do you need help there? Or like, have you heard about this tool? Or what&#8217;s path of least resistance to move from a short code to a block? All those sort of things. So I think yes and no. I think it&#8217;s just overall, having a dev team for the open source project that is WordPress is a great idea to gather feedback and help and just help. Full stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:06] Nathan Wrigley: I think whether it&#8217;s as a result of endeavors from people like you, or just the passage of time. I get the feeling that in the year 2023, the message is really getting through. It seems like the inertia against using blocks seems to be dissipating. I really don&#8217;t seem to be exposed to too many YouTube videos or people on Twitter moaning too much about that anymore. Moaning is probably the wrong word. I should probably reclassify that, questioning it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:38] Ryan Welcher: No, I think it&#8217;s a very accurate word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] Nathan Wrigley: So it feels as though we are at an inflection point. That there&#8217;s enough time that&#8217;s passed. There&#8217;s enough projects out there. There&#8217;s enough people that have released resources and commercial products around the block space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It kind of feels like it&#8217;s moment has really arrived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] Ryan Welcher: I agree, yeah</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:59] Nathan Wrigley: Maybe moving from a position now of teaching people that it exists and it&#8217;s an option, into teaching people how to use it and get the most out of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think since 5.0 the block API has matured, and has stabilized. There was a couple of releases where every release, the function that you called to actually register a block in php, its name changed, and its function parameters changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there was like one version, and then the next version was a slight variation but the next version was the same name as the first version, but with different parameters. So there&#8217;s some confusion there. And you know, with the introduction of block.json, it&#8217;s the json file that describes what your block does and what its functionality is. Having those pieces sort of stable and consistent have really helped the adoption of blocks and custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think also, and this is a perfect segue into what we&#8217;re talking about today, the tools like to Create Block Package that we&#8217;re going to talk about introduced to best practice and showed people, how do I structure my blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I was at 10up, I was at 10up when Gutenberg came out. And we spent a lot of time, the company spent a lot of time trying to figure out, trying to navigate how is this going to work for an agency? How do we build these things? What files go where and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s a huge amount of cognitive dissonance. When you&#8217;re trying to figure out a new api. When you&#8217;re trying to figure out a brand new paradigm. And then you&#8217;ve got to figure out, well, where do my files go? A tool like the Create Block Package just shows you where the recommended structure is. And then that takes away a lot of the guesswork, and then everything becomes consistent at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if I&#8217;m working on a project that someone else has worked on, the files at least are in the same place. And, I think the maturity of blocks and the block API has really left a lot of the people who just didn&#8217;t like it kind of behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:39] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so given that we don&#8217;t really have any accurate statistics on who&#8217;s using blocks. What proportion of the 43% of the web that&#8217;s using WordPress have moved over to blocks, or perhaps are sticking with the page builder that they&#8217;ve been using for the last several years and so on. Given that we don&#8217;t really know that, what is the elevator pitch for blocks really? What are the small things that you can mention on a podcast in a short space of time, which really nail your colors to the master and say, okay, this is the promise of blocks? This is what blocks can deliver. This is why it&#8217;s new, and why it&#8217;s worth looking at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] Ryan Welcher: That&#8217;s a great question. I think that blocks offer, well, first of all, there&#8217;s no theme or plugin lock-in. So that&#8217;s a big concern with, take the example of a freelancer that is hired to build a site and the client is non-technical, but they want to be able to manage their own content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you reach for some of these page builder tools, and now once you&#8217;ve reached for them, you&#8217;re locked into them. That&#8217;s not a criticism, but that is inherently one issue. So with blocks you don&#8217;t have that. Your blocks are part of core and you could still suffer a bit of lock-in, if you went with a very bespoke sort of block set or like a block suite or something, but there&#8217;s definitely some benefits there. You don&#8217;t have a lot of the overhead or any of the overhead that come with some of the larger, page builder plugins, just because they have so many features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s some load considerations there. I think it changes the way that you can look at your content. This is a bit more of a philosophical question, but, so historically when we built a site, we had a title for post content. We had the content, which was like the classic editor. And then we had post meta, and you know tags and categories. But if we wanted to store an extra piece of information with a piece of content, there was really only post meta available to us, because the template that was being shown for the front end that would represent that piece of content ,was controlling the layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we had to store, let&#8217;s use an example of an author byline. Say we wanted to have guest authors on a site. So we wanted to store that author name. Well, on the template side you would use get post meta, the function, to get that piece of information and, and display it in your template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now we can do that all with blocks, because our template is the editor, and the way it looks is basically represented almost one-to-one in the block editor experience and the site editor. So you have this question of, do I need all this post meta now? Now I can just store it as a block attribute, and move it around and do what I need to do with it. So I think there&#8217;s lots of good reasons to use blocks. That&#8217;s a few of them maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s great. Thank you. I guess the primary issue is that using something like a page builder, whether or not it&#8217;s got bloat or whether or not you&#8217;ve got the lock in and all of that, is that it&#8217;s relatively straightforward. You just click some buttons essentially. Drag things onto the canvas and you&#8217;re done. In Gutenberg we&#8217;ve got some core blocks, and increasingly you can really start to lay things out with group blocks and cover blocks and things like that. You know, you really can start to finesse the overall design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you want to do anything bespoke, in other words, if you want to create a block which does something that you wish to do, something new, something interesting. Then you&#8217;ve got to create that block. And the barrier to doing that I feel is quite high. I wonder if you&#8217;ve got any thoughts on that? Whether or not the creation of blocks is still in the domain of, how to describe it? You&#8217;ve got to have a certain fairly high level of understanding of all sorts of technologies to make these blocks come into existence. Or do you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:12] Ryan Welcher: Well, you do and you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s kind of like, it&#8217;s the classic developer question, you know. It depends, is always the answer. Whenever you ask a developer something, it&#8217;s always, well, it depends. But, I think yes. You do need to have a certain amount of information. But take blocks out of the equation. If you wanted to make a bespoke WordPress theme, with custom templates, you still need to have a certain level of development experience and a certain level of prowess in php, html, css and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that&#8217;s not to say that the barrier to entry hasn&#8217;t been raised. Because when I learned WordPress in 2009, I could just copy and paste everything I did into a theme and it worked. Now we&#8217;re with blocks. We&#8217;re looking at, build processes and learning some JavaScript frameworks in React, some knowledge there. So there is, there&#8217;s definitely some things to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there are some tools that can help. Again, this Create Block Package that will kind of get you started and get you a basic scaffold of a block, that you can just then change and add your flourishes to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in general, web development is more complicated than it ever has been. I mean, that&#8217;s maybe because I&#8217;ve been doing it for a long time and I&#8217;m an old man who fears change a little bit, maybe. I don&#8217;t know. But I think that knowing JavaScript and Matt said, you know, learn JavaScript deeply, and it&#8217;s true. I think I felt that pain when I was, starting to work in Gutenberg. I&#8217;m a php first developer. That&#8217;s what I learned. I did a little bit of JavaScript, but not a lot. Learning these new concepts was hard. But, I think it&#8217;s well worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think you can do things where you don&#8217;t need to know, you don&#8217;t need to be an expert in React. You don&#8217;t need to be an expert in Webpack and build process. You don&#8217;t need to be that level. If you choose to be that level, you can, but you can do some pretty complicated blocks, with sort of a base understanding of some of the pieces that you need to put together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think part of my job is to help people navigate that stuff. I&#8217;m a big proponent of the Create Block Package. I&#8217;ve worked on the package. I&#8217;ve helped to add features that developers have asked for to make life easier. One big feature was the ability to have multiple blocks be part of the plugin that is generated when you run the package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think there is a barrier to entry, but I think it&#8217;s mitigated by, like, you don&#8217;t need to be an expert in all the things. You don&#8217;t even need to really understand the build process, for example. It&#8217;s provided, and it&#8217;s just run a command and just know that this command does this and this command does that. And really, if you don&#8217;t want to look under the hood, you don&#8217;t have to. It&#8217;s going to work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:30] Nathan Wrigley: We&#8217;ll get onto the Create Block Tool in a moment, if that&#8217;s all right. But just one last question around this whole education piece and learning about blocks. It feels that there&#8217;s a real concerted effort now to create learning materials. There&#8217;s obviously learn.wordpress.org, and a whole bunch of other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see a lot of videos being created in amongst the community. People like Jonathan Bossenger and Anne McCarthy and so on. And I&#8217;m just wondering if you, well, firstly, if you feel that that&#8217;s the case, if the education piece is a lot better now than it was when you were trying to learn at 10up? In other words it&#8217;s less of an uphill struggle because you&#8217;ve got somewhere to turn to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:09] Ryan Welcher: So much less, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:11] Nathan Wrigley: So let&#8217;s do that one first. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] Ryan Welcher: Absolutely. I think, yeah, you&#8217;re right. I mean, I think that when Gutenberg came out, there was no real pragmatic, like practical, how to use this information. Because it was a new thing and there was a lot being changed and people didn&#8217;t have the resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They didn&#8217;t have the knowledge to build the resources. Now we&#8217;re four years in now, and that&#8217;s obviously built up. The folks that learn.wordpress.org doing a fantastic job. Jonathan&#8217;s stuff is great. I&#8217;m going to shamelessly self-promote here. I stream every Thursday at ten thirty Eastern on Twitch, where we do block development live. and I put that on my YouTube channel. And I&#8217;m not the only one. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s, there are people that are putting out content that is up to date and accessible and easier to figure out the things that you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there&#8217;s always going to be gaps in that knowledge because the APIs are still evolving, and every time there&#8217;s a new release to the plugin, the Gutenberg plugin, there&#8217;s new features and things like that. But yeah, I think now compared to when 5.0 came out, I think there&#8217;s a lot more really good information out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m finding that there&#8217;s older information that hasn&#8217;t been updated. That&#8217;s one of the pitfalls of the writing a tutorial on your blog post or creating a video or doing whatever, is that it&#8217;s sort of a snapshot in time of the APIs. And so it&#8217;s there, but then there&#8217;s, well, hey, did you know that there&#8217;s this new way of doing whatever it is that you&#8217;re doing that&#8217;s a little bit easier, you know, faster, better, smarter, or whatever, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:34] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Going back to your shameless plug. Could you tell us a little bit more about that? So you say you go live, every Thursday, and we will get from you the URL and will post it into the show notes. Do you have an agenda for that? Do you know what you&#8217;re going to do in advance? Or is it driven by who shows up and what questions they want to be answered?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:53] Ryan Welcher: it&#8217;s a bit of both. I&#8217;ve been doing it now for about a year and a half. I&#8217;m on Twitch, which is an interesting experience. So I live code. I usually show up with some kind of agenda. Like, for example, right now, last few weeks, every other week I do a stream on the new features that have been released in the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not aware, the Gutenberg plugin is on a two week release cycle. So every two weeks we get a new version of that plugin, and then all those versions get rolled up and released into the next version of WordPress Core. I go through the release posts on make.wordpress.org, and we call out some of the more developery refocused things like, a new component is added or a new whatever. So we do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The off weeks, I usually build something. Like right now I&#8217;m building a block that integrates with OpenAI to generate images. But the images that are being generated are terrifying because I keep doing like people laughing. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen OpenAI generate people&#8217;s faces. It&#8217;s the scariest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life. Have a lot of fun doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m actually going to be doing one and I haven&#8217;t done this yet, and again, sorry for the shameless self-promotion here, but in a couple of weeks I&#8217;m going to be doing a bring me your block development issues stream, where I&#8217;m hoping that people will submit these problems that they&#8217;re running into and I&#8217;m going to try to see if I can kind of like fix &#8217;em live. And we&#8217;re going to stream that and see how it goes. It&#8217;s going to be wildly successful or it&#8217;s going to be crickets the whole time. I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s usually the only two extremes you get on live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:19] Nathan Wrigley: I do like the idea of a, like an open surgery in a way. Where people can show up and give you their problems and presumably the further in advance they can give you the problems, the more of a chance you&#8217;ve got of actually solving them. But that&#8217;s a really interesting idea and an excellent way to help educate people live, watching somebody else do it, not just on a forum or an email chain. Actually seeing it happen and get an explanation for why you&#8217;re doing things and possibly even watching you make mistakes along the way and having to fix your own things, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:48] Ryan Welcher: If anyone comes to my stream, you will watch me make mistakes Yeah, I can&#8217;t type when people are watching. There we go, that kind of sums my stream up. But yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of good fun. And we have pretty good community of people who hang out in the chat and discuss things and answer questions and help me. There&#8217;s one guy, I always make fun of him because he shows up and saves the day every time if I&#8217;m running into an issue, he&#8217;s like, here&#8217;s your code. And he just pastes it, and I&#8217;m like, oh okay, great. So now we can move on because Kevin saved my stream. So shout out to Kevin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:14] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s a, lovely community feel to it though, isn&#8217;t it? There&#8217;s something really nice about that. But definitely, before we hang up on this call, I will get the location for that and we&#8217;ll post that into the show notes. So if anybody wants to go and hang out with Ryan on a Thursday and watch him live code and possibly take your own troubles and problems and share it with Ryan, yeah, that would be a really amazing enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, let&#8217;s get onto the, what we probably should have started talking about a while ago, but never mind the Create Block Tool or the Create Block Package. So one of the problems that you highlighted right at the beginning when I said, what makes blocks difficult, is you talked about the tooling and the requirements that you need just to get started. So describe the problem that the tool is solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:58] Ryan Welcher: Sure. So if you want to build a block, there&#8217;s a number of ways that you can do it. But if you wanted to build a block using React and JSX, which is the HTML extension, the JavaScript that React uses, you need a build process. You need the ability to take your JavaScript code and transpile, it&#8217;s a fancy word of saying turn it into something else, into JavaScript that the browser can read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to do that you need a build process. And so a build process can be very complicated. Now, build processes have been around forever. If you&#8217;ve heard of Grunt, or you&#8217;ve heard of Bower. There&#8217;s a few, so what we use is Webpack. Now Webpack can be extremely daunting to set up and deal with. The story that I always tell was the first React app I ever built was when I was working for an agency, and they wanted to use Webpack and we went to the Webpack documentation page and all it said was work in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, it was very funny because the only comment on it was a giant picture of that meme of Picard with his arm stretched out going, why? I wish I had a screenshot of that because that&#8217;s best story ever. Anyway, so that&#8217;s your first issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your second issue is how do you even structure blocks? There&#8217;s a number of files and a number of pieces to a block. And, you know, if you put 10 developers in a room, those 10 developers will have 10 different ways of scaffolding this. So that was always a bit of a problem as well. So what this tool does is it solves those problems first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it installs your build process, the one that is actually used by the Gutenberg project as well. It&#8217;s maintained, it&#8217;s got a million little features and you don&#8217;t have to worry about that anymore. And then it also will scaffold the files for your block and put them, give you the names, give you all the files, give you a starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you run the scaffolding tool, it will prefill a lot of the, sort of, details of your block and give you the starting point. And it bundles it all up inside of a plugin, and so it&#8217;s a WordPress plugin that you can just enable and it installs all the dependencies and it even runs the build process. So you literally run it and then you press activate inside your plugin screen, and then you have an active block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That takes away so much guesswork and so much busy work of having to like, figure out the naming of things and add files. It doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but if you&#8217;re building 20 blocks, and you have to like, copy and paste all your files and go in and rename everything, that can take a lot of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I can well imagine how much time that&#8217;s saving. Are there any constraints about where you can install this? So, currently I&#8217;m on a Mac. I presume that we&#8217;re all good to go there. What about Windows, Linux?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:22] Ryan Welcher: The only thing that you have to have is Node. So you have to have Node installed, because you can run it using a command called npx. And what it does is it, it won&#8217;t download it and add it to your project, but it will just kind of reach out and run it once and then do its thing. So you need to have Node installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does work, to the best of my knowledge, it works pretty well across all the platforms. I believe there is an issue in Windows with a very specific configuration that doesn&#8217;t copy a file to the right place. But that&#8217;s less about the scaffolding tool and more about the build process. But there&#8217;s a lot of people that work on this stuff. So I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to be remedied pretty soon, yeah. The only dependency is Node, which is cross platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:02] Nathan Wrigley: Right, okay, perfect. So if I&#8217;ve never done this before and I want to get my first block done. Realistically, how long is it between me thinking, hmm, create block tool, I&#8217;m going to start using that, to having my first block on the page? Are we talking 10 minutes, an hour, less?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:20] Ryan Welcher: Two minutes. Assuming you have Node installed. Let&#8217;s assume that. You can go to the documentation page and you can run npx at WordPress slash create block and give it a name, and it will prompt you for a bunch of questions. Like, what do you want to call this thing? What name space should it be in? You know, what&#8217;s the description?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;ll ask you a bunch of questions and it&#8217;ll just scaffold out the block for you. And the most amount of time is waiting for the dependencies. So that the block needs to be installed and then run. And that, honestly, I did a YouTube video on my channel where I timed it. And I think it took four minutes from start to finish and it was done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you have a fully functional plugin with a single block in it. And you enable it, and like I said, the block is available for use immediately. No, the block doesn&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s a very, very simple block. But that&#8217;s how quickly you can get up and running with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s probably very important at this point to describe the limitations, because when I heard about Create Block Tool, I thought to myself, oh great, a tool which is going to help me to create blocks. Not literally create a block, but, you know, add in options and different, custom data and all of that. And that was what I was thinking I was going to get. So just draw a line, make it really clear what you get when this process is complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:34] Ryan Welcher: You get what&#8217;s referred to as a static block. So there&#8217;s two types of blocks, static and dynamic. And I can get into that if you want, and with no controls. So basically the block will, it shows you a message when you insert, it says hello from the post editor. And then it&#8217;ll render that same message on the front end, and there&#8217;s some CSS that&#8217;s supplied to the front end and the back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a very, very, very basic block. The tool doesn&#8217;t have the ability to say, I want to be able to insert post meta. We can&#8217;t do any of that level of customization, because there&#8217;s just too many options. Like there&#8217;s too many ways that you can build a block, and too many things a block can do. So there&#8217;s just no, there&#8217;s no way for us to build a tool that says, I want to build a block that accesses the REST API to retrieve this custom post type and display all of the information and do all the stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not something that the tool can do. But, what you get is a fully functioning, working block that is scaffolded to best practices, follows best practices. That shows you how to deal with the CSS, and how to enqueue all your different files, and everything is just built and ready to go for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then at that point you have a starting point. So, as a developer, I used to hate having to do the busy work. What this does is this basically gets me a starting point, and now I can add the things that the client is paying me to do, right? I can add the controls. I can add the interface items, whatever you&#8217;re building in your block. Iit gives you the starting point to actually build the thing that you want to build, not the, you don&#8217;t have to do any ramp up to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:01] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, so within two or three minutes you&#8217;ll have a block. All of the files in the right place. Everything&#8217;s set up. Good to go. And then, really, dear developer, it&#8217;s over to you. You got to figure out where to go from there. Do you have any, is there any sort of commenting in the files that&#8217;s been added additionally to give you some sort of pointers as to, okay, this is what this is doing, this file is used for this and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:24] Ryan Welcher: There is. It&#8217;s commented fairly decently. There&#8217;s kind of a fine line because if you want to use these for production, you know you&#8217;re going to be removing a lot of those comments. There&#8217;s a couple of files that every time I use it, I hate how well commented it is because I like to structure my files in a specific way. So there&#8217;s a lot in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, at this point too, the sort of, the structure, the file structure&#8217;s very well documented and it&#8217;s just been adopted. People can change things and people can, it&#8217;s very flexible. You can do it whatever you want, but the best practice has been well defined at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like that muscle memory thing. People just know that, oh yeah, okay. So I want to go to the edit.js file, because that&#8217;s what I, that&#8217;s what I changed to get it to make changes in the block editor experience and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:05] Nathan Wrigley: Do you know if, well, WordPress&#8217;s mission, I suppose, is to democratize publishing. And it would be, I suppose, an endeavor worth undertaking to have a tool which did carry you on from where the Create Block Tool got you to. In other words, a tool which helped you along the process of creating the block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know if there are any endeavors, any quiet whisperings in the dark corners of Automattic about this kind of tool? Is there any plan to do anything like that so that blocks can be created by, well, non-technical people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:38] Ryan Welcher: There are tools out there in the community. Like I would hesitate to say that Automattic has any sort of secret plans, because that&#8217;s not really how it works. It&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s driven by the community. I mean, I know Automattic does employ a lot of developers who do contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a lot of these tools come from the community and, for people like me to talk to folks and be like, hey, that&#8217;d be a really cool feature to add, to Create Block. There&#8217;s been a number of features where we&#8217;ve been like, you know what? It&#8217;s a really great idea, it&#8217;s too specific. So it might be better served as a tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I will say this, the create block package does have the ability to, you can provide what are called templates. So you can create your own custom template. So you can build a block that does X because you&#8217;ve built a template. So I could build a template that is like, all right, I want to block that interfaces with custom post meta. And so I could build that template and when I run the package, I can point the package at that specific template and it will scaffold the files out, and I will have all of those starting points in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not an interactive tool. I don&#8217;t think where you&#8217;ll see, what do you want this block to do? Like, unless somebody comes up with this really cool OpenAI integration, which might be a lot actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:43] Nathan Wrigley: Somebody will probably do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:45] Ryan Welcher: I&#8217;m sure they will. Blocks can do so many things and they&#8217;re so versatile and they&#8217;re so, it&#8217;s sort of like, how do you even start to define the questions that you ask in the automation process to say, what do you want to do? Like, do you need to access data stores? Sure. Is it a custom data store or is it one of the ones that Gutenberg provides? You know, so there&#8217;s a lot, there&#8217;s a lot that goes in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:06] Nathan Wrigley: Does the tool itself get regular updates? I&#8217;m imagining that the technology behind that is fairly fast moving, and there&#8217;s a lot of new updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:15] Ryan Welcher: It is being updated regularly. The package itself gets updated every two weeks when the Gutenberg project, so when the Guttenberg plugin is in release candidate. But there are features being added all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we added the feature not too long ago to be able to copy php files around. And, there&#8217;s a lot of sort of under the hood things that, I&#8217;m drawing a complete blank of all the features that I&#8217;ve added to this thing, but we&#8217;ve added a whole bunch. Here&#8217;s an example. So when you scaffold out the block, all of your JavaScript files sit inside a SRC or a source folder. And people, they may not necessarily want that because they might already have a source folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They might want to call it something like, so if you have an existing project, you might want to call it blocks instead of source. So what we did was we added the ability to be able to target that differently. So you could call it something else. And this works with the scripts package too. So you could define it a certain way and then have scripts look at that. Or one big feature that people were asking for was, we don&#8217;t want to scaffold a plugin every single time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we have an existing plugin, we just want the block. So we built a no plugin mode where you could run it inside your source directory and it would just give you the block files. And now you&#8217;ve got a second block inside that plugin. So those sort of things. And those all came from the community. They all came from people using the package and saying, this is stumbling block for us because we have to copy and paste and move things around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why can&#8217;t we just add a command that does it? So we were able to add that stuff in and it&#8217;s, I mean, I think it drives adoption, but it also. The whole point of this is to make people&#8217;s lives easier. If it&#8217;s more work to use the tool than it is to do it manually, then it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth, you know, the juice isn&#8217;t worth the squeeze, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:47] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. It just occurs to me that we never said where we find this tool. Do you happen to have a handy URL available?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:54] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, you can look in the developer.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m not going to read the whole url, but just do a search for create block. All the documentation is available there. It&#8217;s actually hosted on npm. So, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll add it to the show notes, but the documentation is all there and it explains how to use it and all the available flags and all the available commands that you can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s even a more advanced page on creating custom templates. I really love the custom template idea. Well, what do they call it? They call it external templates. External project templates is the official name. And what it allows you to do is like, if you&#8217;re an agency and you want to build blocks in a very specific way, you can define that and then everyone in your agency is going to use that same template with this package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can use local packages, or you can host them on npm if you want to share them. It&#8217;s very, very, very, very versatile. With that, the sky&#8217;s the limit. You can literally do whatever you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can scaffold the block to do anything, and then just target that particular sort of style of block. Like I built one that would do dynamic blocks because at the time the tool didn&#8217;t support dynamic blocks, and now it does, by the way. My template is obsolete now, but that was a thing that we needed. So if you wanted to build a dynamic block, you would just target my template instead of the built-in one, and you would get that sort of flavor of block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:06] Nathan Wrigley: You, mentioned a little while ago, maybe 20 minutes or so ago, that there was this dynamic block, and you said you might digress into that, but we never did. So let&#8217;s go down that little path just for a moment, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:16] Ryan Welcher: Sure thing. So like I said before, there&#8217;s two types of blocks. We have a static block and we have dynamic blocks. So a static block, the difference is basically where stuff is saved or if it&#8217;s saved. So, in a static block. So all, I&#8217;d say the majority of core blocks are static, meaning that when you hit save, it actually saves the markup into the post content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s saved to the database. A dynamic block doesn&#8217;t do that. A dynamic block uses php to render the front end, the way we would always sort of, add run until the pages loaded and that file is run, and then it displays its information. And that&#8217;s basically the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there&#8217;s some trade offs for both. With static blocks, when there&#8217;s markup changes, you have to do this thing called deprecation. So you tell Gutenberg, if there&#8217;s any developers listening, I&#8217;m sure there are. If you&#8217;ve ever seen that, like, you know, the block, we couldn&#8217;t render the block. There was an error. Everyone&#8217;s seen that error. That&#8217;s because some markup has changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to deprecate that. So that&#8217;s an extra step. Where with dynamic blocks, you don&#8217;t need to do that because it&#8217;s always run live, so to speak, right? So there&#8217;s some benefits to using a dynamic block for that regard. But the trade out there is you have markup in two places. So that&#8217;s, at a high level, the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:26] Nathan Wrigley: And the create block tool will point you in the right direction of creating one or the other, depending on which your.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:33] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, it lets you choose. So there is a flag called a variant, and you can choose between static or dynamic. I believe the default is static. It&#8217;ll give you a static block if you don&#8217;t run that flag. But if you say variant dynamic, it&#8217;ll do a dynamic one. And then there&#8217;s actually, within your templates, this is getting really the weeds, but if you define a template, you can actually have multiple variants. So you could have your own variant. You could have a TypeScript variant for your particular template. Or like a, I don&#8217;t know, Tailwind CSS one. So there&#8217;s a lot of flexibility there is where I&#8217;m going with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:03] Nathan Wrigley: Amazing. So much going on in the WordPress space at the moment. On every level. From straightforward to incredibly complicated. And feel this is on the incredibly complicated side, but really interesting work. You mentioned that you are obviously into this, but there were a couple of other names which came off your tongue earlier. I&#8217;m wondering if in the round, you could just drop some of those names, people that we might like to go and find, as well as yourself, who are working with you, pushing the Create Block Tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:36] Ryan Welcher: There&#8217;s the folks that I work with on my team. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll know all these names. Birgit Pauli Haack is on the team. She&#8217;s the Brains behind Gutenberg Times and all that stuff. Justin Tadlock is on the team as well. I&#8217;m sure everyone knows Justin. There is Michael Burge who is on our team, and think that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:54] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Well if there&#8217;s any that you&#8217;ve missed out, you can always fire them over in my direction and we&#8217;ll make sure, that they get into the show notes. If anybody has been listening to this episode and they&#8217;ve thought, you know what, this is curious. This is something that I need to begin to play with, but I would like to find out a little bit more first. We know you&#8217;ve got the Twitch channel, and we&#8217;ll push people towards that. But what other places can people get in touch with you Ryan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:19] Ryan Welcher: Sure. I have a YouTube channel as well, so I&#8217;m Ryan Welcher Codes in both places, Twitch and YouTube. I try to answer the comments on YouTube as often as possible, but sometimes I don&#8217;t get to them right away, but I&#8217;m at Ryan Welcher on Twitter and my DMs are open, so feel free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Welcher or Ryan Welcher or Welcher Ryan in a million different Slack channels. So, I think I&#8217;m Welcher in Make Slack. I&#8217;m on Post Status. I&#8217;m on Discord in a few places. So just search my name or variations of my name and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll run into me and, I&#8217;d be happy to speak with anyone one-on-one in a public forum, whatever, whatever works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:54] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you for making yourself available, and thank you for talking to us today about the Create Block Package stroke Tool. That&#8217;s been really, really interesting. Ryan, thanks so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:04] Ryan Welcher: Thanks so much for having me and I hope I can come back sometime.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Ryan Welcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan is a developer advocate sponsored by Automattic. He has been developing with WordPress since 2009 and before becoming a developer advocate, worked for agencies large and small and as a freelancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been using WordPress for any length of time, you’ll have come across the new paradigm for content creation, blocks. Every part of your website can now be created and amended as a block. Pages, posts, text, images, headers, footers, navigation and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has widened what’s possible for people who don’t want to mess around with the code of their website. You can add in blocks for almost anything, and change how it looks and behaves from within the block editor interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an excellent move forward, but there’s still an impediment for non-technical people, because creating a block of your own is difficult. If you are able to use the selection of blocks that ship with WordPress Core, or you can find a third party block which does what you need, great, but if you need something specific, you’re going to have to create your own block solution, and that can be hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan is on the podcast today to tell you about the create-block tool, and how it can make your pathway towards block creation a little easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off talking about Ryan’s background, and how he became interested in WordPress. We then move on to how he thinks that the adoption of blocks is becoming more widespread given the maturing of the tools and learning materials available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then turns to how the create-block tool can help you scaffold your blocks. It’s not a tool which is going to build the blocks for you, but it will help you set up the environment and build process, which you need to get started. Really, it’s all about saving you time and effort on things which don’t really get you building your blocks, but which you need to do that work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that you’ll need to have once the tool has you up and running. What level of expertise do you need, and is the tool under continual development?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spend a few moments talking about the livestreaming which Ryan does each week in which he live codes solutions to viewers block based problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve thought about creating your own blocks, but have been put off by the technical barrier, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://10up.com/\">10up</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-examples\">Gutenberg Examples GitHub repository</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Asia</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/\">create-block package</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/create-block\">create-block documentation</a> on npm</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/\">Gutenberg Times</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanWelcherCodes\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ryanwelchercodes\">Twitch</a> channels</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanwelcher/\">Ryan&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"Do The Woo Community: Do the Woo Joins WordCamp Europe 2023 as Media Partner\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74926\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://dothewoo.io/do-the-woo-joins-wordcamp-europe-2023-as-media-partner/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:413:\"<p>We are proud to join others as a Media Partner for this year\'s WordCamp Europe.

McAlister, whose theme company Array Themes was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-array-themes\">acquired by WP Engine in 2018</a>, along with the Atomic Blocks plugin, recently departed from his role at the company to pursue other projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ollie supports all the latest Site Editor features, including global styles,&nbsp;patterns,&nbsp;templates,&nbsp;and template parts. It is a beautiful, multipurpose theme of the high caliber one might expect from McAlister, a veteran developer whose past products were well known for their minimalist and clean design.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Ollie includes an impressive set of more than 50 custom block patterns, making page building a delight. There are page sections for testimonials, company logos, multiple hero designs, pricing tables, various headers and footers, calls to action, and more. Ollie includes six different full-page patterns for the homepage, about, profile, features, pricing, and a download page. They are featured on the theme&#8217;s <a href=\"https://demo.olliewp.com/patterns/\">live demo</a> under the Patterns menu item.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ollie includes seven style variations, with blue, green, orange, pink, red, and teal accent color palettes in addition to the default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other block themes, Ollie is speedy, getting top scores on Google’s Pagespeed Insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the most powerful performance features is the selective loading of assets,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;Instead of loading a large stylesheet on every page, Ollie only loads the styles needed on the page. This results in a much smaller page size, far less page requests, and an instantly-loading page, which search engines love.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing Ollie, I found the user experience to be friendly and an accurate representation of one of the taglines for the theme: &#8220;Get a 40 hour head start.&#8221; As soon as users install the theme and click &#8220;Customize,&#8221; they are taken directly to the Site Editor with the front page template pre-populated to match the demo site. This, combined with all the improvements in the Site Editor in WordPress 6.2, creates a smooth editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although it hasn&#8217;t been officially released yet, Ollie could be one of the next majorly successful block themes, with its sheer number of patterns and flexibility for so many different use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ollie is currently <a href=\"https://github.com/OllieWP/ollie/\">on GitHub</a> during the public beta but McAlister plans to get it approved for WordPress.org after more testing. He is not yet sure whether he will be jumping back into the commercial theme market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With this first block theme, my goal is simply to learn as much as possible about block themes, how users are using them, and what kind of potential there is for a premium offering,&#8221; McAlister told the Tavern. &#8220;This flagship theme will remain as an educational tool and will be free for all to use. Although I have some ideas for monetization, the reality is that we don’t know much about how users will take to block themes or what kind of premium features they’re willing to pay for yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’re very early in this new paradigm, so I’m taking the opportunity to ask lots of questions learn about the problems users are facing. What I do know is that any modern commercial WordPress product needs a supreme customer experience and a wealth of quality education to help users navigate all of these new features and drive adoption.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org has 286 block themes available and even the best ones have just a few thousand active installs. Building block themes that people will want to use is a new frontier, even for McAlister whose former company was a war-horse in the Classic Themes era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Block themes are going to be a game changer for many different personas of WordPress users,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;Being able to customize virtually every aspect of your site is super powerful, but it means that block themes have a lot more moving parts than classic themes. Theme.json, global styles, patterns, templates, template parts — all of these have to be accounted for and they all have to work together seamlessly for an excellent block theme experience.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> WordPress theme developers are still getting a handle on these changes but the Themes Team is putting a stake in the ground by making block theming the focus of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/04/04/theme-handbook-overhaul-proposal/\">Theme Handbook overhaul</a>. Although Classic Themes will still have a chapter in the handbook, the Themes Team has made it clear that block themes are &#8220;the present and future of WordPress.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since a lot of the block theme building is done in the editor, it requires a new mastery of the editor that few are intimately familiar with yet,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;To build patterns or layouts, you need to know which blocks to use, how to structure them effectively, how to leverage your design system in theme.json, and you need a good design sense to pull it all together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, when it all finally comes together, block themes provide an unmatched site building and editing experience in comparison to classic themes. I’m very optimistic about the opportunity to revitalize the WordPress theme space, but it’s going to take a lot of work and collective education to get there.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 04:20:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Do The Woo Community: CloudFest, WordPress Day and a Hackathon with Carole Olinger\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74912\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://dothewoo.io/cloudfest-wordpress-day-and-a-hackathon/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:408:\"<p>For WordPress and WooCommerce builders, CloudFest might be an option to consider for your conference calendar. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/cloudfest-wordpress-day-and-a-hackathon/\">CloudFest, WordPress Day and a Hackathon with Carole Olinger</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 12:42:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: CertifyWP Launches WordPress Management and Design Credential\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=143990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/certifywp-launches-wordpress-management-and-design-credential\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2781:\"<p>CertifyWP has launched its first credentialing exam for a <a href=\"https://certifywp.com/design-and-development-credential/\">WordPress Management and Design Credential</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open<strong> </strong>source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40] Start of Show</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just over 50 episodes ago, I shared some basic thoughts about the four freedoms of open source. I also talked through the most quoted phrase in open source&nbsp; “free as in free speech, not free as in beer.” And honestly, what podcast about the freedoms of open source would be complete without that? If you haven&#8217;t listened to that episode, I suggest you do, but if you don&#8217;t have time, I&#8217;ll start by reminding us all of the definition of free software, which is most commonly referred to as the four freedoms of open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first thing is the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose. The second thing is the freedom to study how the program works and to change it so that it does your computing as you wish. As a side note, access to the source code is a precondition for this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third freedom is the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help others. And the fourth freedom is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes, and of course, also access to the source code is a precondition for this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TLDR version of these freedoms is, essentially, that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software. Now, normally when I speak about the freedoms of open source, I&#8217;m talking about it either from a practical or a philosophical standpoint, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about it from a leadership and organizational perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every once in a while, you might hear me talk about the effects of “open source at scale,” or you might hear Matt say that the four freedoms are essentially the “Bill of Rghts for the open web.” I almost never really dig into either of those topics because it&#8217;s just really complicated. But for starters, anytime you talk about what someone is entitled to or deserves or expects, there is a feeling of political bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while I personally believe that creating software is inherently political or, at a minimum, concerned with the needs of people, that&#8217;s not what convinces anyone to participate in open source, and it&#8217;s certainly not what convinces people to use WordPress. But here&#8217;s the thing, as a leader in a widely used, free, and open source software project, as a leader in WordPress, I also know that every new user to our platform or any other open source platform represents a little more freedom in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little more access to tools and jobs that weren&#8217;t available before. A slightly more open door to networks that undergird the success of entrepreneurs across the globe and a little more equity to the world of democratizing publishing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:28]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I look at the four freedoms of open source, this Bill of Rights for the Web, I see not only the freedoms that we should have but also the things that we should have freedom from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should have the freedom to know how our tools work, the freedom to know what information they need from us, and also the freedom to have some way to make that software work specifically for us because that&#8217;s why we have software because we have humans that need it. But we should also have freedom from having to hide our hacky enhancements or freedom from fear of losing our earned audience, or even the fear of losing access to copious amounts of content that we have created ourselves over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly, the things that we should be free from just include a lot of fear of loss. Loss of opportunity or relevance or livelihood. And I feel like for our project, and maybe for open source as a whole, we&#8217;re encountering a lot of that right now, whether we are aware of it or not. We&#8217;re seeing advancements like GPT3 or ChatGPT if that sounds more familiar and co-pilot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while it&#8217;s not quite in the same vein, also things like Gutenberg. Advancements that are coming to technology around us, technology we&#8217;re familiar with. And it&#8217;s hard to see what&#8217;s in them sometimes. It&#8217;s hard to see what drives them. It&#8217;s hard to know how we can make them work for us. So I have to remind us all, as citizens of an open source community, that what protects us from those things we should be free from is directly connected to how active we are in the things we are free to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hear that in a slightly more routine way from folks around open source communities. Basically, the whole concept of open source software is being built by the folks who show up. You can&#8217;t influence the future of anything if you&#8217;re not showing up in the spaces where the influence happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:35]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So be an active participant in these new technologies. Learn how GPT works and how it could work for you, even if it&#8217;s just writing better prompts. Learn how Gutenberg can support your needs, not subvert your needs, even if it&#8217;s just learning how to arrange a series of blocks into a pattern or patterns into a page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as with all fast-moving technological advances, I encourage you to leap in feet first, not head first. Get in up to your neck in the &#8220;why&#8221;s and &#8220;how&#8221;s of that new technology you&#8217;ve been worrying about. Be the first to become best at this arcane new thing because that&#8217;s why we open source at all so that you have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:33] Small List of Big Things</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings me now to my small list of big things. It&#8217;s a very small list, but it is very big, as always. The first thing is that we are gearing up for the remaining major releases of the year, WP 6.3 and 6.4 in an atypical moment for our project. You can volunteer for both simultaneously if you want, and hopefully, you do want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing is that there are many ways to celebrate WordPress&#8217;s 20th anniversary on May 27th. But one of the things you can do right now is record a short video or sound clip about a great memory or experience you have had in this community or just generally because of WordPress.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the Gutenberg plugin version 15.6, the proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3, and a few things that are in the works again. I&#8217;m your host Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source Project. I&#8217;m thrilled to have with me today, co-host Nick Diego, plugin developer, core contributor as well, and we are both part of Automattic’s Five for the Future project. Nick and I teamed up to manage the Gutenberg plugin release 15.6, so this is fresh from the press, so to speak. Thanks for joining me today again at the Gutenberg Changelog. Nick, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. I&#8217;m very excited that 15.6 is out in the wild now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, me too. And this is a daily dose of Nick Diego for me because the last two days we were in communication about the release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we head into the Gutenberg 15.6 release, let&#8217;s do a few announcements from the WordPress project. As mentioned in the intro, the release schedule for WordPress 6.3 proposal is published and includes a call for volunteers for the release squad. A beta is proposed to be, beta one, is proposed to be on June 27th, 2023. So it&#8217;s after WordCamp and “after after” WordCamp, so to speak, WordCamp Europe. Release candidate and dev notes. Deadline is proposed for July 18th, 2023, and then the final release is proposed to be scheduled on August 8th, 2023. So you raised your hand right, Nick? I raised my hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I did. Yeah. Yes, exactly. So yeah, I&#8217;ve been in the editor triage lead for the last three-year releases and it was a new role when I started. I&#8217;d love to help somebody grow into that role because I love doing it, but we want to see other people in that role as well. And I think it&#8217;s a fun role. It&#8217;s pretty unique. Yeah, it&#8217;s not very technical. It&#8217;s more organizational and just engaging with other release leads and kind of keeping everything moving smoothly. So it&#8217;s a great lead for somebody who maybe is not as technical but wants to really engage with the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, I want to change my role. The last three releases, I did documentation pieces and especially the Gutenberg dev notes wrangle them through GitHub and that is definitely something that somebody that is not technical can do as well. I&#8217;m open to mentor somebody for 6.3 and the proposal for the schedule comes actually on the heels of Josepha Haden Chomphosy’s post, which preparing for the next women and non-binary release squad, AKA underrepresented gender squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you want to be part of it, you can raise your hands in the comments there. And of course we have the links and show notes, but if you haven&#8217;t worked on the major WordPress release squad before, it would be really good and you want to be part of the underrepresented gender squad, it would be good that you also look at the schedule for 6.3 and raise your hand there because quite a few mentors would be available to skill up contributors to be part of 6.4 because that&#8217;s how you get new people in that you need to&#8230; We need to shepherd them through the responsibilities and how things work and who to talk to and how this all&#8230; It can be very intimidating when you haven&#8217;t done this before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So not to throw you into the deep end of the water to swim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s always good to see how the sausage is made and there&#8217;s so much going on and so many people involved. I know when I first did it, I was very intimidated, but after you see it once, it starts to make a bit more sense. So yeah, mentor for 6.3 and then get really well-prepared for 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. And if you want to learn more, yeah, you find us on Twitter or on the WordPress Slack and you can just kind of DM us or ask us some questions there. Well, I volunteered you now. Big sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Oh, if anybody has any questions about the release, feel free to reach out to us. We&#8217;re here to help, here to get more people on board with the release. I know for myself, it kind of kicked off my journey in contributing more to WordPress and it really made me kind of fall in love with the process. And so I highly encourage anybody else who might be even a little bit interested to start exploring it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you want to help the quality race on some of the products, you can also follow the FSE outreach program that has been in place for two and a half years almost. And there is, Anne McCarthy runs the program and you still have until April 26th to follow the testing call number 20. And that is using the create block theme plugin to create a block theme and you get some instructions on the call for testing. It&#8217;s another six days, but if you are not so much into theme development, maybe you want to do the new call for testing that just came out and have some front page fun with a block scene and create some templates that are for the front page. And there is actually also a developer news blog out, blog post out that just came out last week, and that is by Justin Tadlock using the template patterns to build multiple homepage designs. So I don&#8217;t know exactly if they&#8217;re related, but I&#8217;m pointing you to it as well, so you get a little bit broader picture of it. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And I want to stress that these call for testings, even if you&#8217;ve been building with blocks forever and you&#8217;re very engaged, it&#8217;s a great exercise to go through. I consider myself very entrenched in WordPress and know what&#8217;s going on, but sometimes when you go through these testing calls, you find pitfalls or issues that somebody who&#8217;s maybe brand new to blocks would encounter. It&#8217;s a great way to find problems or things that can be fixed to make that onboarding experience smoother. So I know I always find things that I don&#8217;t expect, but the goal of these call for testing is to make WordPress better. And so even if you use WordPress every day, I encourage you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. Absolutely. And if I want to get something done on my theme, for instance, for the Gutenberg Times or for my personal blog and try to do this, I always find something that might be a little quirky, that might be a little bit, oh, I haven&#8217;t thought about that, but now that I use it, maybe there are some things that could be easier to handle or more intuitive or I run into some problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s so fresh from out of the releases that there&#8217;s always&#8230; There is no bug free software. That ship has sailed when we so many people are involved. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But that&#8217;s also something if I get asked, I want to contribute to WordPress, but I don&#8217;t know how. So I&#8217;ll appoint them to the testing calls because it&#8217;s gets them hands-on with the WordPress site and also contribute back by just giving feedback. You don&#8217;t have to know the processes. You don&#8217;t need to know any development, but when something doesn&#8217;t work right and you can raise your hand and say, I found something and explain that to other people. And Anne has been very good in creating GitHub issues for the developers and to feed that back into the development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For the community contribution, I wanted to point out Ryan Welcher started a new series on his Twitch stream and it&#8217;s called Bring Me Your Issues. And he uploaded the first of the few issues for persistence on YouTube, and I wanted to point you to it. He also went through the work and added chapter timestamps to it, and especially for the first one that was really helpful because that&#8217;s a two and a half hour Twitch session. I really admire his persistence and his patience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can look through the list of the topics that he covered and one of them&#8230; So I can only say three things, but that it was more so how to use the create block scaffolding tool. It&#8217;s always interesting to see that and how to build an edit block for the lockdown user. So edit post block I should say. And that&#8217;s certainly something that could come to core, but if it&#8217;s easier&#8230; Yeah, relatively easy to build, you can build it yourself. Then he answers the question, what and why inner blocks, which is a component that is for block building. And then another question is how to create a placeholder and parent and child relationships for your block development and using the example of a post pickup block. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s a goldmine of tools and how to do different things, so if you haven&#8217;t checked out Ryan&#8217;s streams, you definitely should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and there&#8217;s a second edition of it, where you can learn more about the get post type selectors in the data store and the use entity records, all technical terms, that you will know so easy after you listen to that. The render appender, I like that. The render appender on the inner box. And then in the third edition here, Ryan also talks a little bit over the Gutenberg 15.5 release and how to create a external template for APIs for the great block scaffolding tool. Always a good thing to know so you can create your own templates for the tool. There was actually also a topic at one of our Gutenberg live Q&amp;As was Grzegorz Ziolkowski and Fabian Kagy. It&#8217;s a couple of years old, but it&#8217;s still very, very current with demos and additional background on how to create those templates. So we share all this in the show notes. I know it&#8217;s a little bit tech and developer happy, heavy, happy too, but I just wanted to point out these new resources and additional resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So GiveWP published a block-based visual donation form builder. That&#8217;s a mouthful, and it&#8217;s in beta. So GiveWP has, in an earlier episode, we discussed GiveWP&#8217;s way to rebuild the powerful donation plugin with our block first mindset and starting off with a WordPress native components and scripts to build the interface and only use custom code to augment it. And the visual donation form builder, it&#8217;s getting better, is the first product that comes from this effort. And if you work for an agency that helps nonprofits fundraise using the GiveWP Plugin, this beta is definitely for you. It&#8217;s also for you when you are working at a nonprofit organization and you are responsible for the fundraising and creating the campaign-related forms. This is also a beta for you. So it gives you early insight in what&#8217;s coming to GiveWP in the version 3.0. And it also gives you a better feel for what will be possible with a new form builder that isn&#8217;t available right now. So check it out, GiveWP. We have the link definitely in the show notes to the beta announcement, and that&#8217;s it from our community contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Lots of good stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 15.6</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So what&#8217;s released this week? We have Gutenberg 15.6 and we are coming right from it. It was released yesterday and the release post is also available now. It includes a total of 112 PRs. It&#8217;s a smaller release in comparison to the ones that come closer to a major WordPress release. It was authored by 45 contributors and seven of which were new contributors. So congratulations everyone on the good work and let&#8217;s get into what&#8217;s in there. And we&#8217;re starting out with, we now have spacing presets to the spacer block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, this is what I&#8217;m so excited about. We&#8217;ve had&#8230; Since 6.1, presets were added to WordPress, which allow you to do a little slider for margin and padding and block app. It&#8217;s configuring margin or padding can be kind of complicated, but when you have a preset of small, medium, large or 1-2-3-4-5, it just makes it a little bit easier for the user. And the way that you could apply those, is you could actually make them fluid, using clamp to make them fluid, which allows for really interesting designs that don&#8217;t require media queries because you can make all your one margin for desktop, another for mobile. We didn&#8217;t have that for the spacer block, which adds vertical height between different blocks. So if you had a hundred pixel spacer block, you wanted it to be smaller on mobile, you would need to use custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now spacing presets come to the spacer block, which also in turn allows for fluid spacer blocks, which people have been asking for forever. Because the spacer block is such a natural tool. It&#8217;s so easy to add for end users. It makes sense. I want to add some space between these two items. Okay, add the spacer block, but now that they&#8217;re fluid&#8230; Now that you can make them fluid, it allows for dynamic websites where you have one size on desktop, another for tablet and another for mobile. And it&#8217;s all on this fluid spectrum and you don&#8217;t need media queries. You don&#8217;t need anything else. You&#8217;re just using these spacing presets. So I couldn&#8217;t be more excited. I&#8217;ve only have just began exploring this and I know other theme developers are as well, so exciting stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Yeah, thank you so much for telling us about it. I also want to point out a blog post that&#8217;s on the developer blog and it kind of talks about that fluid part of intrinsic design versus media queries for theming and thinking about how designing WordPress makes it a little bit more modern when you&#8230; Because the proliferation of screen sizes, you are probably not very content with just three media or three sets. You might need 12 sets or 6 sets, and who keeps track of all the different settings for all these presets? Intrinsic design, that&#8217;s a fluid typography. That&#8217;s a fluid spacing. It&#8217;s definitely a way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t say that you cannot have any media queries, but it&#8217;s definitely for the strategic way to build websites. It&#8217;s the way to go now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then we had, the cover block had border support, but now you also have these pop over resizable box and I think it also was in 15.5, but cover block has now a great border support. You can have the radios. You can have the colors. You can have the resizable block kind of&#8230; Resizable blocks adhered to those. Yeah, that was really nice when I tested it. I&#8217;m not quite sure that&#8217;s 5.6 native, but it&#8217;s definitely improved with 15.6</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: In 16.1, we did a huge effort to add all these design tools to most blocks, but border was left off a handful of them. One of them being cover block because of the clipping so if you did a background image and you tried to put border radius on it, you&#8217;d need to use overflow. It just became tricky with CSS and it took some more time to figure out how to implement that correctly. And so we finally got there and I think that this has been one of those things, why isn&#8217;t there border control? I thought, well, it was a little more tricky than we expected. So it&#8217;s nice to see it here and it really opens up a lot of designs and again, removes some extra custom CSS that you may have needed in the past to achieve a specific design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So next thing on the list of change of was, add styles section to the&#8230; Well, they call it browse mode sidebar, but it&#8217;s the style editor of the style. Well, somebody called it site editor dark side as well, so which I don&#8217;t feel slightly better. It&#8217;s the left sidebar that is on the site editor. And now there is a style section where you can see all the styles that come with the theme, the style variations, and when you click on it, you see how your site changes, but there&#8217;s also an edit button there. So you can then go and open up the right side and change some of the settings for the style variation. And that is a very fluid workflow. I really love that. And it&#8217;s now in the Gutenberg plugin, so it&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Before you had to know where the style variations were. You had to click into the template, then go to the style panel. And so this just makes it much more surfaced for users, allowing you to easily switch your style variation out. Great improvement, and also that name to be determined left-hand sidebar. That will get more features as we go on as well. But this is one additional addition beyond templates and template parts and navigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those are the four main items right now. Yeah, navigation, global styles, template and template parts. And there might be a pattern in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Hopefully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hopefully. Yes, yes, yes. And then in Gutenberg 15.6, there&#8217;s also two experiments. One is a new block that the details and summary block, which mostly was working by Carolina Nymark and she did a fantastic job, shepherding that for maybe a year until it actually got merged as an experiment into the plugin. It&#8217;s how you can hide things. You write a movie review and you want to hide the spoiler part where you reveal some of the drama in the movie, but you want your users to know or readers to know that you making a choice here. You open it up and it&#8217;s a spoiler. You can also hide some details on certain things. There are numerous of use cases and it&#8217;s quite nice because it has all the design tools. It has the typography. It has the spacing. It has the backgrounds, the colors. So it&#8217;s actually a nice little block and it can use some testing, but you need to go to the menu of the Gutenberg plugin into the experiments and check it on. Yeah. Have you used it Nick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I played around with it quite a bit. I think that the colloquial term would be an accordion, is basically kind of what we&#8217;re talking about here. It&#8217;s really hard to do in an accessible way, which is one of the reasons why this has taken so long to get into WordPress. Core, that is. And so I think Carolina did a great job. The current experimental implementation includes a number of a parent block and then a number of child blocks. There&#8217;s another exploration that&#8217;s maybe trying to simplify that. But either way, we&#8217;re getting closer and closer to having this block and core and it&#8217;s something that everybody&#8217;s asked for. So why isn&#8217;t this in core? We want this in core. So it&#8217;s, it will get there and I think this is a great first step. Encourage everybody to try out the experiment. Find problems with it. Find out how we can make it better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Excellent. And then there&#8217;s another experiment. It&#8217;s called a command center for the site editor. And that is really a rough interface right now if you switch it on. Yeah, don&#8217;t expect too much user-friendliness in there because it&#8217;s still in an experimental way. So if I understood this correctly, you get a little search bar like the spotlight on a Mac or so, and then you can say edit something or change color or so and it will get you to the place where you can actually do that. So you wouldn&#8217;t need to know all the 15 levels of menus to get to a certain place. I have not played with it. Did you test it a bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yes, so we&#8217;ve been all hearing about artificial intelligence these days. AI is everywhere, and this is not AI, but it&#8217;s an experiment to start exploring one, how you can move things around. How you can move around the site. You could tell it, I want to add a new page, but you can also start to see where in the future you could hook in&#8230; third-party extenders could hook in a different additional functionality into this command center to do, write me a post about Mars, whatever. You can start to think about where this could eventually go, which is why this is currently an experiment, but the baseline is going to be take me to the styles panel, add a new page, simple things. But it could be huge. It could be a really important component of what WordPress is. And so really test it out, start exploring it. The idea behind it is it&#8217;s going to be very extensible, so you can add additional functionality as a third-party extender. So really excited to see where this goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, me too. And then there are quite a few, I call them or we call them here, quality of life kind of enhancements you don&#8217;t know that you need it until you see that what you get. And one of them is the smoother animations for the drop zone and what is a drop zone? It&#8217;s not a movie thing. You go from drag and drop and to drop, you need to know where you it’s is actually going on your canvas and the animation that&#8230; So there&#8217;s a blue line appearing on your canvas and it tells you, okay, your drop thingy will drop here when you release the button if you wanted to. And the animations are much smoother. It&#8217;s actually a delightful experience now to drag and drop blocks from one section to the other or from the list view over&#8230; From the list view over to your canvas. So that&#8217;s a very nice addition there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really nice. And then there&#8217;s some improvements to list view itself around dragging. I&#8217;ve run into it too. You see sometimes you drag items within the list view and it’s&#8230; Things don&#8217;t go exactly where you want them to. And one of those was dragging underneath a container like a group block was a little challenging. And then they&#8217;ve improved that as well. So dragging and dropping and got it much easier across the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and that I think were all the highlights that we wanted to point out today from the Gutenberg 15.6 release. We will have the release post in the show notes so you can follow up on things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we want to talk to you about what&#8217;s in active development and what&#8217;s coming down the line. And first off is the work with patterns. So I hear this over and over again. I want to create my own patterns. Why can&#8217;t I do this with WordPress? I need a plugin. And we know all the good plugins. There&#8217;s a, Justin Tadlock had a plugin to create patterns and Block Meister was one, and then WP Engine came out with a pattern builder. And so Ari has a work in progress to add UI to allow saving patterns. And we definitely share that and it&#8217;s coming along fine, but it&#8217;s still a work in progress. And I don&#8217;t know what are the problems they&#8217;re hitting? Do you have a feeling on how that&#8217;s difficult?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, I think it&#8217;s one of those things where we have all sorts of different entities in the block editor. We have reusable blocks. We have templates. We have template parts. What do you use when? What do you use where? And so I think that not only the functionality of being able to save a pattern, but also the UI around saving a pattern and making it clear to users when you should use one over the other and in what context things should be used. So there&#8217;s a technical issue and then there&#8217;s also a UI understanding user experience issue as well. So it&#8217;s getting there. It&#8217;s great to see this happening in core patterns are such a great way to create content and then use it in different places. And being able to do that in core would be such a huge benefit. It would allow you to design something, save it as a pattern, go to a different page, use your pattern. There&#8217;s just so many delightful applications of this and really excited to see it moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it definitely needs to be in there. And there&#8217;s also a work done on the WP pattern block, which allows you to create patterns or use patterns in template parts. So that&#8217;s also reusable designs that are already available to use them in templates, so you can reuse, have them on every type of page that you want to be on. That is also in the works. It definitely comes together with the UI for the patterns as well. So look out, we have the links for the PRs, will be in the show notes, so if you want to check it out and keep a tab on it, feel free to do those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, and I think that the long and short of it is patterns are under the hood a very simple thing. It&#8217;s just a collection of blocks. And the initial implementation of patterns was just that. It was a collection of blocks that you could deploy in different places. Now that people are starting to expand and adopt block-based WordPress, it&#8217;s become very clear how powerful patterns can be. And now we&#8217;re seeing all these like, well, can it do this? Can it do this? Can we do it here? Yeah. And so we&#8217;re trying to address those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I just want to&#8230; Just had the idea, we talked about pattern before and I pitched that developer news post where you can have patterns for particular templates, and that&#8217;s also part of that idea where you can expand. How you can use it. How can theme developers support users in creating what they need to create on their websites and be fast with that? Yeah. So that&#8217;s also part, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that was definitely had a lot of questions and a lot of requests was getting revisions on the global styles for the interface. So contributors look to implement revisions and display them in the global styles. There&#8217;s current and experimental implementation that shows a separate revision menu item in the global styles. And when you selected, you can see the latest revisions, the preview of them in the editor, and you can also go back to the latest revision and change it again. Or there is also a restore of unsafe changes and also a reset to the science of the theme. So there was, the design team did lot of thinking about how that can be displayed. And now developers are working on some iterations on the PR before it&#8217;s merged. And it will certainly need some thorough testing, but I wanted listeners to know that that is coming as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, revisions are such a big thing when you make those changes in the site editor can be a little discerning because you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m making all these changes. How do I get back? How do I get back to a design that I liked before and it was clicking the back button a million times or just a little&#8230; It was tough. So there&#8217;s a revision, especially visual revisions where you can go back and see what the changes that were made I think is going to be really important for broader adoption of the site editor. So great to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And when users do make their own designs or make changes on their design, sometimes they don&#8217;t know what the final design looks like until they actually have it and then they don&#8217;t like it anymore and then they need to go back and that these revisions definitely will help with that process. I&#8217;m that way. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the last item that I have in the list for, or we have in the list for you to learn that is discussed and in the works is again, a little bit more developer oriented, but now there is a PR one issue discussed on how to get allowed blocks into the blockchain meta. It is an attribute for the inner block. So if you have a custom block and you want other blocks in there, you can restrict which blocks can be put in there, but you are not able to add this to your&#8230; A data point to your outside block. And that is something especially for developers that restrict them or they find solutions around it. And if you&#8230; Yeah, one is if you want to restrict an instance of the media and text block, that it only can do heading, paragraph, and image, but you can tell the media and text block that is what you want them to put in there. So developers do all kinds of interesting things to work around this, but there should be a standard in core and the developers are working on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;d love to see this extensibility. When the block editor is being built, obviously, you need the core components to be built, but I think we&#8217;re finally out of time where a lot of things are stable and now is really how do we allow people to make changes, extend different components. One of the beauties of WordPress. You can change anything. You can configure it in many ways and getting some of that configurability into more configurability into the block editor is great. So these little things that may seem minor have huge impacts for developers&#8217; lives and what they&#8217;re trying to implement. So great to see this happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I was thinking about, well, this is an issue that&#8217;s discussed for four years now. And finally there are enough use cases, there have been enough ways to use the block editor and extend an editor, and now there&#8217;s a real need there to actually have that discussion come to fruition into a PR or into a new feature that helps the developers to extend things. And I think we will see through the year of 2023, the next two major WordPress releases, certainly additional things that add more extensibility to the block editor, especially to the site editor and to custom blocks. And it&#8217;s exciting times and I&#8217;m really glad that we are there now just before the next phase of Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. And with that, dear listeners, we are at the end of the show. It was a shorter show, but I&#8217;m glad I had Nick with me for you and could talk to you about a few things that are beyond the Gutenberg plugin release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before the end of the show. I remind you if you want to help WordPress get better, heed the call for testing, either building a block theme with a block plugin in the 20th testing call or rating front pages, different kind of front page for your website. So anything else that you want to add to things that we haven&#8217;t talked about that you were top of your mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: No, just encourage people to go check out 15.6 and that call for testing. Embrace blocks and try to push the block editor to his limits. And if there are issues, let us know and we&#8217;ll help make it better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, so you changed jobs, Nick? Have anything but you are not new to our listeners. That&#8217;s why we kind of cut through the introduction a little bit. But have anything&#8230; If people want to get in touch with you, has anything changed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Nope. The best place usually is just on Twitter or obviously WordPress Slack at NDiego. On Twitter, NickMDiego. So feel free to reach out to me with your questions, comments, suggestions about WordPress. Here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And we have a new video of you, Fluid Spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m going to make more of those. I&#8217;m going to be trying to do more little shorts about different features that come out in WordPress so we&#8217;ll see how that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the first one is out today and we will have the link in the show notes and it talks about the spacers, spacer block. And so let Nick know what you think about and what your ideas are for new little shorts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast.

In a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/19/status-update-on-the-sqlite-project/\">update</a>, Yoast-sponsored core contributor Ari Stathopoulos said the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/\">SQLite Database Integration</a> feature plugin has been rewritten, with the help of Automattic-sponsored core contributor Adam Zielinski, to be a more future-proof implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The code has been completely rewritten to use an SQL Lexer and is now stable and able to handle all WordPress queries properly,&#8221; Stathopoulos said. &#8220;The SQL Lexer is part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/phpmyadmin/sql-parser\">PHPMyAdmin/SQL-Parser</a> project (licensed under the GPL 2.0) and it was adapted for WordPress, effectively implementing a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/pull/9\">MySQL to SQLite translation engine</a>. This provides improved security, as well as compatibility.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stathopoulos contends that the next step is to implement these changes in WordPress core &#8220;instead of using a plugin,&#8221; because in its current form it can only be tested on pre-existing websites that already have a MySQL database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Using the <em>featured</em> plugin is a great way to allow users to test the implementation and iron out any issues etc,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However, long-term, it doesn’t make sense to use it as a plugin.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stathopoulos created a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220\">draft Pull Request</a> and an accompanying <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57793\">Trac ticket</a> proposing the new implementation be merged into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the effort has received positive feedback and support from the community and WordPress lead developer Matt Mullenweg, the feature plugin has only 30 active installs and the new implementation has received very little testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple participants in the discussion, including core committer Aaron Jorbin and lead developer Andrew Ozz, expressed concerns about the proposal&#8217;s call for merging the changes to core as the next step. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Talk of merging to core feels incredibly premature for a couple of reasons,&#8221; Jorbin said. &#8220;The plugin now only has around 30 installations. I think there needs to be much higher adoption in order to understand how the near-infinite number of plugins will work with this deep underlying change to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorbin also referenced WordPress&#8217; philosophy of building things for end users who don&#8217;t want to have to make decisions about the underlying tech but simply want things to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Assuming that a user is going to understand different database engines and the potential tradeoffs feels far stretched to me,&#8221; Jorbin said. &#8220;Therefore, any implementation really needs to be rock solid and extremely thoroughly tested.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorbin also echoed concerns of other contributors in previous conversations, about <a href=\"https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html\">SQLite&#8217;s bizarre religion-infused &#8220;code of ethics</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozz suggested the plugin could be added to WordPress as a mu-plugin or a &#8220;drop-in&#8221; similar to how caching add-ons are implemented, pushing back on the rigidity of the requirement to fully merge it into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Both of these methods are also better/more suitable for the users as they can be done by the hosting company or the script used for WordPress installation,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;There are some other benefits like independent updates, etc.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stathopoulos responded to these concerns, saying that he sees the merge to core as a long-term goal, although the proposal communicated more of an urgency that confused participants in the discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is premature,&#8221; Stathopoulos admitted. &#8220;However, looking at the bigger picture, it is not premature to plan for the future and get ready for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It may be premature now, but it won’t be 2 years from now… The problem is that we won’t be able to do it in the future unless we start working on it now.<br />SQLite is not something that can – or should – happen in Core now, or even a year from now. It’s a long-term goal, and should be treated as such.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stathopoulos agreed that the plugin needs more adoption to see how it works with plugins across the ecosystem. He also responded to concerns about users not fully understanding the implications of the database engine they select on installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The proof-of-concept UI I put in place in the Core PR is just that – a proof of concept,&#8221;  Stathopoulos said. &#8220;Something to trigger discussion and allow us to find solutions. It can be anything, even installation scenarios (do you want to create a blog? A small e-commerce site? A large news outlet? The next Amazon?) That is a discussion that will need to happen when the time is right to discuss UI, but it’s is a bit too early for that, I don’t think we’re there yet.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stathopoulos recommends contributors test the new implementation with all the plugins they normally use, via the <a href=\"https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/\">SQLite Database Integration plugin</a> or by testing the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220\">draft pull request in WordPress Core</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 21:37:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WordCamp Central: WordCamp Jinja 2023: Empowering the Future Generation of WordPress Users in Africa\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3164522\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:124:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/04/wordcamp-jinja-2023-empowering-the-future-generation-of-wordpress-users-in-africa/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7502:\"<img src=\"https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2022/files/2023/04/WordCamp-Jinja-2022-attendees-in-the-Computer-Lab-at-Jinja-College-on-2nd-Sept-2022.jpg\" alt=\"WordCamp Jinja 2022 attendees in the Computer Lab at Jinja College on 2nd Sept 2022\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Inaugural WordCamp Jinja 2022 attendees in the Computer Lab at Jinja College School on 2nd Sept 2022</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">At the heart of every revolution lies a spark that ignites the collective spirit, driving the wheels of change and inspiring the future.

The extra Contributor Day, scheduled for the 6th of September at <a href=\"https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/location/\">The Innovation Village in Jinja</a>, will feature a Website Hackathon to further engage and inspire the attendees as their skills are put to the test to create stunning websites with WordPress in a limited time, working in teams and competing for prizes and glory!.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that by fostering a spirit of learning and collaboration, we can help shape the minds of the future, ensuring a legacy of innovation and progress. To achieve this, we are extending a warm invitation to speakers / trainers. If you have a story to tell, knowledge to share, or inspiration to spread, please submit your proposal through our Call for Speakers page: <a href=\"https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-speakers/\">https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-speakers/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are also seeking sponsors who believe in our mission and would like to support WordCamp Jinja 2023.
